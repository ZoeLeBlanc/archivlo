Given the archive's strengths in U.S. and Mexican materials, UT Arlington is uniquely positioned to take on this project. Though fought entirely on soil claimed by Mexico, the war remains very much an American story for historians in the United States. This website, as its title suggests, seeks to address this imbalance, adopting a binational focus to examine the war as part of a larger and more integrated North American narrative.\nJust as this project aims to bridge the histories of two very different nations, it also seeks to serve two separate audiences. Scholars actively engaged in research and teachers looking for ways to engage their students tend to approach the same subject in very different ways. It is hoped that this project will be of benefit to researchers by making available for the first time online one of the largest collections of primary source materials on the U.S. - Mexico War. At the same time, this website is also designed for teachers, by providing educational resources that can be used in the classroom. Ultimately, the goal of A Continent Divided is to promote interest at every level in the issues that confronted the two North American republics as they struggled to define themselves during their early national periods.\n\n About the Collection\nUT Arlington Library's Special Collections serves as the repository for one of the most comprehensive archives relating to the U.S. - Mexico War in either the United States or Mexico. The core of these holdings was acquired by Fort Worth attorney Jenkins Garrett, who in 1973 donated to UT Arlington his collection of more than 10,000 discrete items on Texas and the war with Mexico, including broadsides, sheet music, manuscripts, maps and graphic materials. In 1995, Garrett and Special Collections librarian Kit Goodwin compiled a bibliography of the collection entitled The Mexican-American War of 1846-1848: A Bibliography of the Holdings of the Libraries. Garrett continued to add to the collection until his death in 2010. The UT Arlington Library is also committed to expanding these holdings. See About the Collection for more information.\nThis archive was compiled by the Center for Greater Southwestern Studies at the University of Texas at Arlington and is composed of materials held in the University of Texas at Arlington Library Special Collections.\n\n Contact Us\nFor more information, please contact the Center's Director, Prof. Sam W. Haynes.\n\n\n\n"

There is both a library and an archive. The archive has two main parts, the Historical Archive (Archivio storico), which includes 12,000 documents that cover the period from 1753 to 1911. It is searchable by author, title, keyword, or call number here. The Modern Archive (Archivio moderno) contains everything after 1911, and is searchable here. The Accademia also possesses a large database of photographic and illustrative material, and hosts the Tassinari Collection. Giuseppe Tassinari was a noted professor of agronomy, member of the Accademia, and an important figure in the Ministry of Agriculture during the Fascist period. The Collection includes his writings and some personal papers. In addition, the Accademic has a large library (the Biblioteca).\n\n Research procedures\n Access\nThere is no charge, nor are any credentials or letter of introduction required, but visitors must fill out a card registering their presence. No appointment is necessary and the staff is very helpful.\n\n Permitted and prohibited items\nPermitted: Notebooks, personal computers, pencils.\nProhibited: Food and drink, pens, and consultation of historic volumes without archival gloves. Smoking is also prohibited inside the Accademia.\n\n Document ordering and delivery\nThere is a difference between the consultation of the library and the archives. For the library, visitors can consult up to three volumes at a time (or one old volume), and there are no \"prese.\" In other words, a new request can be made after finishing with each volume, not only at specific times like many Italian archives. To request a document or book, the visitor simply fills out a request form. having found the call number either online or in the complete work of the Accademia's holdings (available at the Academia). The works requested are then consulted in the Sala di Lettura (Reading Room). Consulted works can be left \"on deposit,\" with the exception of rare books. There is no interlibrary loan available.\nThe Historic Archive can only be consulted on microfilm, and then only three microfilm rolls at a time. Only in rare occasions that the microfilm version cannot be read can the original document be requested. The Modern Archive can only be consulted with an appointment.\n\n Photocopying, photography, microfilming\nThe Accademia will do photocopying or high-resolution scanning for a small charge. For the former, the usual limits are in effect (Italian law prohibits copying more than 15% of any work), and any poorly-conserved works cannot be photocopied. Both scans and photocopies must be requested. Publishing scanned material is possible with a formal request, a small fee, proper crediting, and two copies of the final work. Photocopies can be done the same day, scanning is usually done within a few weeks but depends on the amount of work the archivists have.\n\n Key individuals\nDavide Fiorino is the person responsible for the archives, and the best contact person.\n\n Practicalities\nThe archive is in the center of Florence and is therefore surrounded by inexpensive caf̩s and overpriced restaurants. The Accademia has a bathroom and lockers for bags, and personal computers are allowed.\n\n See also\nThe Accademia dei Georgofili's Wikipedia entry in English\nThe Accademia dei Georgofili's Facebook page\nThe Accademia dei Georgofili's LinkedIn profile\nA description of the Accademia dei Georgofili in English on the Life Beyond Tourism portal\n\n\n\n"

Once you arrive on base and pass through security (see additional notes below), follow the main road briefly past the post office, then veer to the right when the road forks. When this road ends at Chennault Circle, turn right. Parking can be tricky, but try the large lot on the right just past the church-like building. AFHRA is on the opposite side of the circle, set in with a parking lot separating it from the road.\n\n Holdings\n\"The Air Force Historical Research Agency is the repository for Air Force historical documents. The Agency's collection, begun in Washington, DC, during World War II, moved in 1949 to Maxwell Air Force Base, the site of Air University, to provide research facilities for professional military education students, the faculty, visiting scholars, and the general public.

Additionally, check out http://www.airforcehistoryindex.org to search for materials pertinent to your topic. You may be able to identify nearly all materials of interest through this online search engine. Alternately, AFHRA has an on-site database you can also use.\nMaterials are available in hard copy and on microfilm at the facility. The request process is simple: fill out a form with the call number and beginning/end dates for the document(s) you would like, then give it to a staff member.\n\n Access\nMaxwell is a closed based. You MUST be \"sponsored\" on to the base by a staff member. This is why you must contact AFHRA in advance. When you arrive, go to the visitor's center just outside the main gate. You will need your car registration and automobile insurance, as well as a driver's license. If AFHRA has not sent your sponsorship to the gate, you can call them and they will take care of it immediately.\n\n Permitted and prohibited items\nPermitted: laptops, scanners, cameras\nProhibited:\n\n Document ordering and delivery\nRequest forms allow space for about 10 distinct items.

The Main Collection holds approximately 13,000 volumes; the Hamid Sulaymanov Collection some 7,300 volumes; and the Duplicate or Doublet Collection some 5,000 volumes. The Main Collection has three card catalog categories: subject, author and title. The card catalog for Hamid Sulaymanov is organized only by language and title. Lastly, the card catalog for the Duplicate Collection has no organizing principle: it lists works in a wholly random manner, giving each a consecutive number starting from one. Moreover, the name ���duplicate collection�۝ is a misnomer: some of the copies can be quite old, suggesting that valuable manuscripts were also assigned to this collection.\nAlthough the card catalogs are generally sufficiently detailed, experts I met with at the Institute state that the trade-off between the pace and quality of work and the level of expertise of the earlier cataloguers took its toll. Quite a few works are either misidentified or left unidentified. Fortunately, the Main Collection has a print catalog in addition to the card catalog: Sobranie Vostochnykh Rukopisei, 11 vols., Tashkent, 1952-1987. However, the staff at the Institute again caution that this catalog, although rich, is not particularly systematic or comprehensive. I was informed that work is currently in progress on similar print catalogs for the Hamid Sulaymanov and Duplicate collections.\n\n Research procedures\n Access\n(what permits, identity documents, or letters of reference do you need to present? how far in advance must you begin to register?)\n\n Permitted and prohibited items\n(if possible, account for laptop computers, cameras, scanners, phones, pens and pencils, loose papers, and so on)\n\nPermitted: Laptops are allowed while working. \n\nProhibited: Cell phones are to be kept in backpacks, suitcases, etc., which may be left on a table in the reading room. There is a no camera in the building policy: they do not carry out searches but if they notice a camera they remind you of the policy and ask you to keep it in a room other than the reading room during research. \n\n Document ordering and delivery\nManuscript access is very straightfoward, and three manuscripts are typically given out at a time. \n\n Photocopying, photography, microfilming\nTo obtain digital copies of manuscripts, one must submit a petition to be approved by the president, Dr. Bahrom Abdulholimov. Since he also holds the position of vice president of the Uzbek Academy of Science, he spends half of his time away from the Institute. Researchers who require his permission and signature must learn his schedule and submit their requests accordingly. His permission is necessary on other occasions as well, but the staff is helpful in contacting him over the phone for his permission when that is possible. Also, there is only one staff member who is authorized to scan manuscripts for digital copies, Argash Kamilov, and he is not always at the Institute. Requests for digital copies should therefore never be left to the last minute.\nThe rates for digital copies run from US $4/folio for entire works (defined as an entire volume between two covers) to US $2/folio for partial copies (anything less than an entire volume). On this and previous visits I did not encounter any limitations on what can be digitized; as long as one has the permission to work with a given manuscript, it is also possible to digitize the desired sections.\n\n Key individuals\n(give names of archive staff and other individuals who can help researchers)\n\n Practicalities\nI stayed at a hotel for the length of my visit, Uzbek National House (95 Soghbon St.). This is a traditional Uzbek house with several rooms opening onto a central courtyard. Some of the rooms have a private bathroom with shower, others use common facilities. My room was ensuite, with two beds, and included breakfast. The rate for this room was US $40/night (though because of my earlier connection I paid a bit less). It is about 50 minutes from the Institute by public transportation, which is quite cheap, or half an hour by taxi (7,000-8,000 sums).\nHowever, for longer research trips a short-term apartment rental is preferable, if one can be found. This can cut accommodation costs significantly (it is around US $300/mo. for a furnished, three-bedroom apartment). But it may be significantly harder to arrange because of the legal issues involved. In Uzbekistan every foreign national must have a registration document stating the address and duration of stay. As an easy solution, hotels supply this document. When renting an apartment, the landlord must be willing to deal with the bureaucratic procedure of ensuring registration.\nThe above-mentioned registration document is one�۪s crucial connection to the Uzbek bureaucracy, and should therefore be kept with you all times along with your passport. Though police identity checks have become less frequent of late, they still happen with some regularity, so this is the document they will want to see after the passport. It makes one traceable in the country. If you decide to change hotels or go on an overnight excursion the hotel manager is bound by law to make sure that you have this document showing that you stayed at an officially recognized institution the night before. Not being able to document your location while in the country will definitely invite trouble.\nIn terms of currency, it is strongly recommended that you carry US dollars in intact but not newly issued bills. Slightly damaged or newly issued banknotes are likely to be refused at official or unofficial exchange points (July 2012 official rate: US $1 = about 1,800 sum; unofficial market rate: US $1 = 2,700 sum). The Euro is at a disadvantage, and it was surprising to note that the Pound Sterling was not commonly recognized in the marketplace.\nFor an internet connection, the best solution is to get a USB modem from one of the telecommunication companies. Beeline is especially recommended as I found them to offer the \nmost reliable service, but this should be checked as things can change very quickly in the Uzbek economy. By visiting a branch with my passport I was able to get a phone number and a modem for about US $35. Internet cafes appear to have become less prevalent in recent years.\n\n See also\nErtu��rul ��kten's description of a visit to this archive in July 2012 [1] was the chief source of this wiki's information.\n\n\n\n"

But the papers are held off-site, and need to be requested at least 48 hours in advance. \n\n  Online Catalogs and Finding Aids \nThere is no online finding aid for the AHA's Papers, but the Manuscript Reading Room has a highly detailed paper finding aid on site.\n\n Collection Summary\nThe AHA's Papers consist of 901 boxes of records, covering all aspects of the organization's work from its establishment in 1884 up to 1979. The materials in the collection range from mundane membership correspondence to wide-ranging discussions about the proper work of the discipline.\n\n Usage Discussion\nSuggestions for approaching the material: As a starting point, you should read through the AHA's annual reports for the period you want to study, which summarize the major activities and personnel. After 1895 the work of the Association begins to break up into a number of different hands and committees.  The finding aid is useful for identifying the material in each box, but the actual materials in the box can be highly varied depending on the source of the materials. In the 1920s and 1930s, for instance, the work of the Association was split between executive secretaries working at their home institutions, and the Assistant Secretary, Patty Washington, in the Association's central office. Unfortunately, all the early boxes for this period indicate they are \"Secretary's Correspondence,\" but the materials from Patty Washington's files tend to be very mundane financial and membership material (boxes 60-64), while material from executive secretaries such as Dexter Perkins and Conyers Read dealt with far-ranging issues of the discipline. Since there is no clear distinction between one set of materials and another, this makes for highly varied results depending on your subject of study. And be sure to note that materials were added to the collection at much later periods, with large collections of council and committee materials showing up in the higher ranges of boxes.\nRelated materials for the AHA in the Manuscript Reading Room can also be found in the J. Franklin Jameson Papers (spanning 1895 to the 1930s), Bassett, John Spencer, Papers (particularly during his term as executive secretary from 1920 to 1928), and the American Council of Learned Societies Papers (which includes materials gathered by Waldo Leland Gifford after he left his post as secretary of the Association in 1919).\n\n\n  Major Topic Areas \n\n\n"

      "Archive_Info": "The Jacob Rader Marcus Center of the American Jewish Archives (AJA), located on the historic Cincinnati campus of Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion, was established in 1947 by renowned historian, Dr. Jacob Rader Marcus to collect, preserve, and make available for research, materials on the history of Jews and Jewish communities in the Western Hemisphere, including data of a political, economic, social, cultural, and religious nature.\nToday the AJA houses over ten million pages of documentation. It contains nearly 8,000 linear feet of archives, manuscripts, nearprint materials, photographs, audio and video tape, microfilm, and genealogical materials. The AJA exists to preserve the continuity of Jewish life and learning for future generations and aspires to serve scholars, educators, students, and researchers of all backgrounds and beliefs.\nIn effort to advance this mission, the AJA publishes the American Jewish Archives Journal (AJAJ). The AJAJ documents and preserves the American Jewish experience through the publication of scholarly articles and analyses of primary source documents written by academic and talented amateur historians from around the world. It also contains important news about the AJA and book reviews of relevant secondary literature. This journal is considered one of two major refereed periodicals in the field of American Jewish history.\n\nContents\n\n1 Address and Contact Info\n2 Hours and Usage Restrictions\n3 Online Catalogs and Finding Aids\n4 Collection Summary\n5 Usage Discussion\n6 Fellowships and Funding Opportunities\n7 Major Topic Areas\n\n\n Address and Contact Info\nThe Jacob Rader Marcus Center of the American Jewish Archives\n3101 Clifton Ave\nCincinnati, OH 45220-2488\nPhone: (513) 221-1875\nFax: (513) 221-7812\nWeb page: americanjewisharchives.org\nContact: Kevin Proffitt, Sr. Archivist for Research and Collections\n\n Hours and Usage Restrictions\nMonday-Thursday: 9am-5pm\nFriday: 9am-3pm\nScheduled closings are posted on the AJA event calendar.

We are presently at work retro-cataloging our entire collection. If you do not find what you are looking for or have any questions, please Ask an Archivist!\nOnline Finding Aids\nThe AJA creates finding aids for all of it's major manuscript collection. All finding aids are available online.\n\n Collection Summary\nBelow are broad descriptions of the types of material you'll find at the American Jewish Archives.\nManuscripts\nThe archival and manuscript holdings of the American Jewish Archives include over 800 major manuscript collections and almost 16,000 smaller collections. All major manuscript collections (finding aids) and a portion of the small collections are cataloged in the AJA Online Catalog.\nPhotographs\nThe AJA Photograph Collection consists of over 25,000 images. It is heavily used by scholars, filmmakers and videographers, among others, to illustrate books, articles, films, and television programs. The complete photograph collection is cataloged in the AJA Online Catalog.\nMicrofilm\nThe AJA's microfilm collection consists of over 4,000 reels, including copies of the papers of Rabbi Stephen S. Wise, Supreme Court Justice Louis D. Brandeis, Zionist leader Chaim Weizmann, and the records of the Socialist Labor Party of America. A portion of the microfilm collection is cataloged in the Online Catalog.\nMedia\nThe AJA holds nearly 10,000 audio and video recordings consisting of oral histories, lectures, religious services, and music. A portion of this collection is cataloged in the AJA Online Catalog.\nNearprint\nThe archival-manuscript holdings of the American Jewish Archives are complemented by a large collection of ephemeral materials: newspaper and magazine clippings, leaflets, brochures, pamphlets, and organizational news releases. These materials are brought together in the \"Nearprint\" collection, which is divided into three categories:\n\nBiographyGeographySpecial Topics and Institutions\nThe Nearprint collections reflect the day-to-day development of Jewish life in mid and late twentieth-century America. Scholars invariably find in this collection data that does not appear in manuscript or non-ephemeral published sources. The Nearprint collection is cataloged in the AJA Online Catalog.\n\n Usage Discussion\nPlease see the AJA visitors' guide for information on reading room policies and logistical information, such as parking and nearby accommodations.\n\n Fellowships and Funding Opportunities\nThe Fellowship Program of The Jacob Rader Marcus Center of the American Jewish Archives was established in 1977 by our institution's founder, the late Dr. Jacob Rader Marcus. Since its inception, more than 350 scholars from over 20 countries have been named Marcus Center Fellows.\nThe Marcus Center's Fellowship Program was founded with the intent of creating a forum where students and scholars of the American Jewish experience could gather together to research, discuss, and study their chosen topics. Under the auspices of this unique program scholars come to Cincinnati to conduct in-depth research at the American Jewish Archives and to take part in the academic community of the Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion. The program provides fellows with an opportunity not only to pursue their own research, but also to interact and exchange ideas with research peers as well as with the faculty and students of HUC-JIR.\nToday, The Marcus Center administers fifteen endowed fellowships, all funded by generous friends and supporters of the American Jewish Archives. Marcus Center fellows are teachers, students, scholars, and practitioners who, both individually and as a group, come to the American Jewish Archives to study some aspect of the American Jewish past. It is The Marcus Center's hope that this Fellowship Program will advance our understanding of American Jewish history and, simultaneously, of the American nation as a whole.\nFor more information, please see the AJA Fellowship Program webpage.\n\n Major Topic Areas\nCollection Policy\nThe Jacob Rader Marcus Center of the American Jewish Archives identifies, collects and preserves records of enduring value that document American Jewish life. Its collection development program reflects the diversity and distinctiveness of the North American Jewish community.\nCore Areas of Interest\nAs one of the world's largest archives for the study of North American Jewry, the American Jewish Archives collects major records that relate to Jewish life in the Americas. It focuses intently on four core areas of interest:\n\n\nThe records of American Jewish personalities and institutions deemed to possess historical significance;\nThe records of American Reform Judaism���its institutions and significant personalities;\nThe records of American Jewish communities���with a special focus on the records of Cincinnati Jewry;\nThe records of the Hebrew Union College���Jewish Institute of Religion.\n\nThe American Jewish Archives may periodically elect to acquire and maintain other records of special significance. When considering collections that relate to Jewish life outside of the United States of America, the American Jewish Archives will carefully consider accepting those records that have extraordinary research or historical value.\n\n\n\n"

L'acc̬s y est libre et gratuit. La consultation des documents et des ouvrages se fait exclusivement sur place, en salle de lecture, dans le respect des d̩lais fix̩s par les lois en vigueur. \nUne carte de lecteur est d̩livr̩e �� l'accueil, sur pr̩sentation d'une carte d'identit̩.\n\n  La recherche \nLes responsables de la salle de lecture informent le public des proc̩dures de demandes de documents, leur pr̩sentent les diff̩rents instruments de recherche mis �� leur disposition (guides, inventaires et r̩pertoires, fichiers etc.) et les orientent dans leurs premi̬res d̩marches.\nLe service r̩pond ̩galement aux demandes de renseignement par correspondance, indiquant aux chercheurs les r̩f̩rences bibliographiques et l'̩tat des sources susceptibles de leur ̻tre utiles. En revanche, il n'est en aucune mani̬re tenu d'accomplir des recherches en lieu et place des lecteurs ni de r̩aliser, pour le compte de ceux-ci, des travaux tels que le d̩pouillement de liasses ou de registres ou la transcription et la traduction de documents. \n Les demandes de renseignement par t̩l̩phone ne sont pas prises en compte.  \nLes personnes qui, pour des raisons administratives ou juridiques, ont besoin de pi̬ces prouvant leurs droits (attestations de ch̫mage, de naturalisation, relev̩s cadastraux, copies de jugements etc.) re̤oivent un accueil et une aide sp̩cifiques.\nEnfin, pour faciliter les recherches g̩n̩alogiques, il est possible d'obtenir en communication dans la salle de lecture, par le syst̬me de pr̻t-inter, les microfilms des registres paroissiaux et d'̩tat-civil qui ont pu ̻tre r̩alis̩s dans les autres d̩partements.\n\n  La reproduction de documents \nDans la mesure o�_ l'̩tat des documents le permet et �� condition que la prise de vue ne nuise pas �� leur bonne conservation, le service peut d̩livrer �� titre on̩reux des reproductions (photocopies, photographies, fichiers num̩riques etc.)\n Les lecteurs peuvent ̩galement r̩aliser par eux-m̻mes des prises de vue, apr̬s en avoir obtenu l'autorisation ̩crite et sous r̩serve que les originaux n'aient pas �� en souffrir.\n\n  Activit̩s ̩ducatives et culturelles \n Le service ̩ducatif\nLes Archives d̩partementales de l'Aude se sont dot̩es d'un service ̩ducatif qui sensibilise et initie le public scolaire �� la recherche historique en le familiarisant avec le patrimoine ̩crit du d̩partement et en le confrontant aux documents originaux. Dans ce cadre sont propos̩es aux ̩l̬ves des activit̩s vari̩es��: d̩couverte des m̩tiers des archives, travaux de groupes sur dossiers, ateliers p̩dagogiques (calligraphie, sigillographie, h̩raldique) etc.\n\n  Les expositions \nDes expositions sont r̩guli̬rement organis̩es �� l'intention du public le plus large, soit �� la Maison des m̩moires,soit sur le site m̻me des Archives d̩partementales de l'Aude. \nCertaines de ces expositions deviennent ensuite itin̩rantes��: elles sont pr̻t̩es gracieusement aux associations, aux collectivit̩s ou aux ̩tablissements scolaires qui en font la demande. \nColloques et publications contribuent ̩galement �� mettre en valeur les sources de l'histoire audoise.\n\n\n\n"

      "Archive_Info": "(From the archive's website:) \"The Archdiocesan Archives of Manila is the repository of our Catholic history. Its documents and holdings provide us with information about the Church�۪s colorful past.  However, at some point in our history, it suffered the tragedy of neglect. Fortunately, and just in the nick of time, some persons with the vision and know how  for the preservation of the past, have combined resources and directed efforts to arrest the ravages of neglect, conserve and organize  the bulk of what remained of the collection for the benefit of today�۪s researchers.\"\nBrief History\nHistory of the Church in the Philippines is tied up with the history of the Spanish colonial period since religion was at the very core of the colonial lifestyle.\nRecord collection of the Church provides historical materials for writing. Record keeping was part/parcel of the colonial lifestyle of early missionaries\nArchiving antedated the organization of the Diocese of Manila in 1579 as seen in the Manila�۪s earliest chuch record kept at AAM dating back to 1573. The Pope elevated Manila into an Archdiocese in 1595\nEcclesiastical organization remained unchanged throughout the Spanish colonial period but the gaps in the church records may be attributed to the losses during the 20th century transfers from the Arzobispado in Intramuros\nto the University of Sto Tomas in Espa̱a St. in Manila before the war\nto the Archbishop�۪s Villa in Mandaluyong after the war\nto the San Carlos Major Seminary in Makati in 1969 and to the original home in Intramuros, in the reconstructed Arzobispado de Manila in 1987.\n\nContents\n\n1 Orientation\n\n1.1 Coordinates\n\n1.1.1 Address\n1.1.2 Website\n1.1.3 Telephone\n1.1.4 Fax\n1.1.5 Email\n\n\n1.2 Schedule & hours\n1.3 Working language(s)\n1.4 Directions to the archive\n\n\n2 Holdings\n3 Research procedures\n\n3.1 Access\n3.2 Permitted and prohibited items\n3.3 Document ordering and delivery\n3.4 Photocopying, photography, microfilming\n\n\n4 Key individuals\n5 Practicalities\n6 See also\n\n\n Orientation\n Coordinates\n Address\n121 Arzobispo St., Intramuros, Manila\n\n Website\nhttp://www.rcam.org/offices/archives.htm\n\n Telephone\n527-7631 to 36 loc. 222; 527-5838\n\n Fax\n Email\nrcam.archives@gmail.com\n\n Schedule & hours\nThe Archdiocesan Archives of Manila is open for research only on Tuesdays and Thursdays, from 8:30am to 11:30am and 1:30pm to 4:30pm.\nOnce your application is approved, please arrange a schedule for research with the AAM staff in-charge.\nSubmit the subject or topics of research to the AAM staff in-charge, who alone is authorized to have access to the Stack Room and bring out the documents to the Search Room.\n\n Working language(s)\nSpanish, Tagalog, English\n\n Directions to the archive\n Holdings\nArchival Collection\nThe Roman Catholic Church in the Philippines was juridically established in 1579  with the organization of the Diocese of Manila as a suffragan to the Archdiocese of Mexico. In 1595, Manila was elevated into an archdiocese, consisting of three suffragan dioceses, namely: Nueva Segovia in the Ilocos, Nueva Caceres in Southern Luzon and Cebu.  Later in 1865, the Diocese of Jaro was also erected. \nMost of the Archival Holdings at AAM are Spanish manuscripts. Although the Spaniards were very good at record keeping, the gaps in our Archival Holdings may be attributed to the losses during the 20th century transfers and the destruction of documents due to poor storage conditions.\nIn 1976, Sr. Ma. Rita Ferraris, RVM prepared a Summary inventory of the Archival Holdings.  This classification is based on provenance and the functions of the Archdiocesan Office.\nArranged into 4 main record groups totaling some 600 cu. ft.\nGeneral Administration consisting of records pertaining directly to the functions of the Archbishop of Manila and of the administration of the archdiocese with 7 series\nArchbishop�۪s Council and auxiliaries, other ecclesiastical units, office of the economus and the financial aspects of the administration consisting of 6 series\nPersonnel consisting of series on diocesan clergy and another on religious clergy\nAsuntos Generales as a miscellany to cover varied items outside the 3 main record groups\nValuable collection includes the following:\nCedularios (from 1573) which are orders from Spanish monarchs\nObras Pias (from 1615) which is money dedicated to pious works\nCapellanas which are donations by families to the church for their intentions\nAnales Ecclesiasticos de Filipinas (1681) which deals with the history of the Church in the Philippines, specifically on the life, powers and activities of the metropolitan archbishops of Manila and the suffragan bishops of the colony\nThe Archival Holdings are arranged into four main Record Groups. Each Record Group is divided into several Series.  Under each Series is a group of Sub-series. Under each Sub-Series are Folder File units, and under each Folder File are the  archival documents.\nThe documents are carefully placed in folders, which in turn are stored in non-acidic archival boxes. The boxes are housed on metal shelves at the AAM Stack Room  that provides an environment with controlled temperature, humidity and lighting.  The total AAM collection is about 700 cu. ft.\nThe four main Record Groups and Series are as follows:\nGeneral Administration (RG.I) ��� divided into 8 Series (i.e., S.01 to S.08)\nSacraments (RG.II) - divided into 6 Series (i.e., S.01 to S.06)\nPersonnel (RG.III) - divided into 2 Series (i.e., S.01 to S.02)\nAsuntos Generales (RG.IV) - divided into  3 Series (i.e., S.01 to S.03)\n\n Research procedures\nTo facilitate research, Finding Aids are readily available the Archives. A researcher, who  wishes to consult any available Finding Aid may simply request an AAM staff for assistance.\nSome of the more important and commonly used Finding Aids are as follows:\nArchives of the Archdiocese of Manila: A Summary Inventory by Sr. Maria Rita Ferraris, RVM.

Tonino Cabizzosu, in advance, and to bring a letter of recommendation with them when they come to the archive for the first time. The letter should be directed specifically to Msgr. Cabizzosu, not a general, \"to whom it may concern\" sort of letter. A passport is necessary for registration. Users must make a 1 euro \"donation\" each day they come to the archive.\nFirst time users are likely to be interviewed by the director. As always, be as specific as you can be about which documents you would like to see.\n\n Permitted and prohibited items\nPermitted: laptop computers, pencils, loose papers, notebooks\nProhibited: cameras, pens\n\nUsers reading manuscript materials must wear latex gloves. These may be provided upon registration, but it would be prudent to bring your own.\n\nDocuments must be placed upon the lecturns for reading. Do not place documents on the desks, and do not lean on them. Do not use a pen or pencil to follow line by line while reading; instead, use the cards provided on the lecterns.\n\n Document ordering and delivery\nTo order a document, fill out a request form (available from reading room staff). Requests must include series and document number. Give the form to one of the reading room staff. The document will be delivered to you at your desk.\n\nIndices are located on the bookshelf in the reading room. There are also a good number of auxiliary volumes, including basic Church histories, histories of Sardinia, and dictionaries.\n\n Photocopying, photography, microfilming\n(what are costs, permits, and page limits?  how long do you have to wait?)\n\n Key individuals\n(give names of archive staff and other individuals who can help researchers)\n\n Practicalities\nLockers are located inside the reading room. Washrooms are located across the hallway, directly opposite the reading room. There is no internet access, and only one outlet, so make sure your computer battery is fully charged.\n\nThere is no cafe on site.\n\n See also\nhttp://www.ersucagliari.it/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=577&Itemid=172\n\nhttp://www.videolina.it/view/servizi/7115.html\n\n\n\n"

No document requests can be made from about 11:30 to about 1:00 or after about 4:30, but the reading room remains open.  Closed weekends, national holidays both fixed (such as 7 Sept.-Independence Day, Christmas day, etc.) and movable (such as Carnival, Easter, and Corpus Christi). \nThe reading room is located at the far left corner of the courtyard.  Sign in at the front desk each day.  You may take pencils, paper, cellphones, and laptop computers into the reading room. All other personal belongings should be stored in one of the small lockers before you enter the room.  Users keep the key while in the room.  Some desks along the walls of the room are close to outlets.  If you need a dictionary, there is a reference bookcase with Portuguese/English dictionaries and an especially helpful dictionary of 18th and 19th century Portuguese abbreviations.  You have to get permission to use your own dictionary.\nPolitely introduce yourself to the desk attendant, explaining what you are researching.  They should give you the bound guides to the collection divided into \"Se̤̣o Colonial / Provincial\", \"Se̤̣o de Arquivos Republicanos\", \"Se̤̣o Fazend��ria / Alfandeg��ria\", \"Se̤̣o de Arquivos Privados\", and \"Se̤̣o de Arquivos Judici��rios.\"  On your first day, the desk attendant will start a \"ficha\" (card) for you with your name, degree, and nationality.  You use this card to make all requests from the archive, filling in the Section and document numbers.  The attendants will use this to keep track of what you have checked out.  You may request up to five documents at a time.  The staff are very helpful, but with the long mid-day break in filling document requests, make sure to plan your research carefully to have have some new sources at hand.  As you do more research, they will staple a new card to your ficha. \nIf you have a good relationship with the archive employees, you can keep documents checked out overnight by writing your full name, the date, and \"Em uso\" on a piece of paper and leaving the document on the glass cabinet in the back of the room.\nNo photocopying is allowed, but researchers can ask for permission to take digital photographs of documents.  You fill out a form at the reading room desk requesting permission, and then are taken to get official approval from the administration.  The florescent lights in the reading room are not very bright, so it takes practice and a steady hand to get usable digital images with no flash.\n\n  Online Catalogs and Finding Aids \n Collection Summary\n Usage Discussion\nSuggestions for approaching the material:\nHousing and getting by for less in the area: \n\n\n  Fellowships and Funding Opportunities \n  Major Topic Areas \n\n\n"

Exit from the west side of the station, walk half a block north along Av. Cruzeiro do Sul, and the temporary entrance to the archive during the expansion will be on the left.\n\n Holdings\nColonial documents\nLocal, state, and national newspapers - This includes local papers like the Folha de S. Paulo, O Estado de S. Paulo, and Jornal da Tarde, as well as smaller local papers; national papers like the Jornal do Brasil, and newspapers from all over the interior of the state. It is not uncommon for long runs of any given newspaper to be unavailable due to never-completed microfilming, so check before you go if the newspaper you want is available for the years you need.\nPublic records\nPersonal archives - Among others, the archive of former President Washington Luis and the personal archive of former governor Adhemar de Barros are held here.\nDepartamento Estadual de Ordem e Pol�_tica Social (DEOPS) - Perhaps the most well-known and frequently-consulted collection at the archive, the DEOPS records contain the files of the state political-social police that monitored politicians, social movements, labor, religious organizations, and others for subversion during the Estado Novo, Populist Republic, and military regime. The files include informants' reports on various groups' activities and meetings, as well as personal files on politicians, revolutionaries, labor leaders, etc.;\n\n Research procedures\n Access\nYou must register at the entrance with a passport, RG (Brazilian identity document), or RNE (foreigner registration document). No advance arrangements are required.\n\n Permitted and prohibited items\nPermitted: Laptops, cameras, scanners, pencils, loose paper.\nProhibited: Bags, pens (not enforced), cell phones (not strictly enforced).\n\n Document ordering and delivery\nThe DEOPS records are fairly thoroughly listed on a computer catalogue available for consultation at the archive. Most other holdings are listed in paper binders on a shelf in the main reading room. Retrieval usually takes 5-10 minutes.\nYou may request up to three folders/items at a time for retrieval and may view them one by one. You must wear latex gloves while handling any items from the archive.\n\n Photocopying, photography, microfilming\nPhotography is permitted (no flashes allowed - strictly enforced). Tripods are also permitted. Uncertain about photocopying procedures. Microfilming is not available to researchers.\n\n\n Practicalities\nAs of November 2009, the archive began a R$20,000,000 (US$12,000,000) renovation and expansion, scheduled for completion in August 2010, that will nearly double the size of the archive. In the interim, researchers must deal with the noise of drills, jackhammers, and other construction equipment, as well as a reading room that frequently changes location as the construction progresses.\nThere is no food or coffee available. There is a water cooler by the main entrance, which, depending on how hot it is that day, may or may not have any water in it. There are a few cheap lanchonetes nearby, a couple of fairly decent per-kilo restaurant on Rua Mal. Od�_lio Denys, some fast food in the nearby Tiet̻ bus station, and a variety of restaurants in the food court of Shopping D, a 5-10-minute walk across the bridge over the Tiet̻ River. \nThere are lockers in which you must leave any purse, bag, or laptop bag you have brought with you.\nOn-site parking is unavailable during the renovation, but there are several pay lots nearby. However, considering Ṣo Paulo traffic, public transportation is much more convenient.\nThere is no Internet access, wireless or wired, currently available, and electrical outlets for laptops are limited. If you have a laptop with a three-pronged US or a UK plug, bring an adapter, as some of the outlets only accept round two-pronged plugs.\n\n See also\nhttp://www.arquivoestado.sp.gov.br/index.php\n\n\n\n"

You may read that ANRI is open on Saturday mornings, but this is a deceptive reference to the fact that the \"historical diorama\" in the lobby of the ANRI building is open to the public Saturday morning; no archive access services are offered on Saturdays.  The archives are also closed on all national holidays (\"tanggal merah\").\n\n Working language(s)\nOf course, the two languages that comprise 99% of the archived material are Indonesian and Dutch.  The ANRI staff are prepared to help patrons in Indonesian and English, and Dutch in a pinch.\n\n Directions to the archive\nMost taxis, when given the address on Jl. Ampera, will know immediately where that is, but if they need their memory jogged, you can tell them it is near the South Jakarta District Court (Pengadilan Tinggi JakSel).\nIf you want to reach ANRI on public transportation, the following buses/ angkot pass right in front:\n\n From terminal Blok M��: Kopaja P19, Kopaja S605, Kopaja S605A, Kopaja S63.\n From terminal Pasar Minggu��: Kopaja S605A, Mikrolet M36, KWK S11.\n From Kampung Melayu��: Kopaja S612\n From Tanah Abang��: Kopaja P19\n From Kampung Rambutan��: Kopaja S605\n From terminal Lebak Bulus��: KWK S11\n From Depok��: S63.\n\n Holdings\nANRI's holdings are a haphazard collection from a wide variety of sources, with widely varying levels of completeness, skill in their cataloging, upkeep, etc.  An incomplete online catalog is available at http://www.jikn.anri.go.id/archives.aspx , but one can only search it for keywords, not browse by collections.  Also, be advised that this catalog does not incorporate many of the catalogs available in hard copy in the ANRI reading room; perhaps only one-third of the post-independence collections have been entered.\nThe most basic division in the collection is between paper archives (Arsip Konvensional) and multimedia archives (Arsip Media Baru).  After that, the other major division in the collection is between colonial-period (anything before August 17, 1945, including a large amount from the Algemeene Rijksarchief in the Netherlands) and independence-period (August 17, 1945 forward) documents.\n\n  Dutch Algemeene Rijksarchief Collection \nThis collection includes sub-groups of religious organizations (20 collections), educational organizations (19 collections), and regional organizations (9 collections), as well as general collections (34 collections).\n\n  Colonial Period \nThese archives are organized both regionally and by ministry, with special free-standing collections for certain individuals and organizations.\n\n  Independence Period \nThe independence period collection includes both institutional archives and personal collections.  The institutional archives (Arsip Institusi, organized by their collection numbers at ANRI) are as follows:\n\n RA1\tAlgemeene Secretarie 1944-1950\n RA2\tSekretariat Negara RI, 1945-1949\n RA3\tJogja Documenten 1946-1948\n RA4\tPemerintah Darurat RI (PDRI), 1949\n RA5\tKabinet Perdana Menteri RI, Yogyakarta, 1949-1950\n RA6\tSekretariat Negara RI Yogyakarta, Desember 1949-1950\n RA7\tKabinet Presiden 1950-1959\n RA8\tDelegasi Indonesia 1947-1951\n RA9\tKonstituante 1950-1952\n RA10\tPidato Presiden RI Soekarno 1958-1967\n RA11\tKementrian Dalam Negeri 1945-1949\n RA12\tKementrian Penerangan 1945-1949\n RA13\tKementrian Penerangan 1945-1949 (buku kedua)\n RA14\tKementrian Sosial dan Perburuhan 1946-1950\n RA15\tKementrian Pertanian 1950-1981\n RA16\tKementrian Keuangan 1950-1969\n RA17\tWakil Perdana Menteri Bidang Ekubang tahun 1966\n RA18\tKementrian Pertahanan 1946\n RA19\tKepolisian Negara 1947-1949\n RA20\tAngkatan Laut 1959-1964\n RA21\tBadan Pekerja Komite Nasional Indonesia (BPKNIP) 1945-1950\n RA22\tSOBSI 1950-1965\n RA23\tNahdatul Ulama (NU) 1954-1979\n RA24\tPalang Merah Indonesia tahun 1948-2002\n RA25\tSekretariat Wakil Presiden HB IX tahun 1973-1978\n RA26\tSekretariat Wapres Adam Malik tahun 1978-1982 \n RA27\tBoven Digul 1927-42, 1954\n RA28\tPersatuan Wartawan Indoensia, tahun 1969-2001 \n RA29\tKabinet Perdana Menteri RI tahun 1950-1968\n RA30\tKwartier Nasional Gerakan Pramuka tahun 1961-1979 \n RA31\tDaftar orang-orang Terkemuka di Jawa\n RA32\tIkatan Pemuda Pelajar Indonesia 1945-1971\n RA33\tSekretariat Menko Perhubungan dengan Rakyat 1963-1966\n RA34\tPP Muhammadiyah\n RA35\tDepartemen Angkatan Laut\n RA36\tNetherlands Forces Intelligence Service 1946-1949\n RA37\tBAPEKAN 1959-1962\n RA38\tKoninklijk Bataviaasch Genootscaap\n RA39\tKabinet Presiden Republik Indonesia Serikat 1949-1950\n RA40\tAnggota DPR-RI\n RA41\tMenko EKUIN Pengawasan Pembangunan 1994-1999\n RA42\tDepartemen Agama II 1976-2000\n RA43\tLegiun Veteran RI Wil Jawa Barat\n RA44\tLegiun Veteran RI Wil DKI Jakarta\n RA45\tLegiun Veteran RI Wil DI Yogyakarta\n RA46\tLegiun Veteran RI Wil Jawa Timur\n RA47\tTromol Pos 5000 Wil DI Aceh 1989-1995\n RA48\tTromol Pos 5000 Wil Sumatera Barat 1989-1995\n RA49\tKeputusan Presiden Periode Tahun 1950\n RA50\tUndang-undang Periode Tahun 1950\n RA51\tUndang-undang Periode Tahun 1959\n RA52\tPeraturan Pemerintah Pengganti UU Periode Tahun 1959\n RA53\tPeraturan Pemerintah\n RA54\tInstruksi Presiden 1959-1960\n RA55\tPenetapan Presiden Tahun 1959\n RA56\tPeraturan Presiden Tahun 1959\n RA57\tMeneg.

For information on this process, see Research Procedures for Foreigners.  Although legally the National Archives are bound to require this of any foreign citizen, the current staff has only just begun to enforce this requirement and only of graduate students, not senior scholars, and not from certain institutions with which they have longstanding relationships.  (This could be seen as good hospitality or blatant corruption, depending on how you feel about the fees paid when getting a research permit, which allow facilities like the National Archives to remain open.)\nIndonesian citizens merely need to present a copy of their KTP (and, for students, a letter from their university) to gain access to the archives.\n\n Permitted and prohibited items\nLaptops, notebooks, pencils, ink pens, and looseleaf paper are all welcome in the reading room.  Cameras or scanners of any kind are not permitted.  Cell phones are tolerated, but any cell phone conversations must be taken outside.  Of course, food and drink are prohibited in the reading room.\n\n Document ordering and delivery\nDocuments are requested on a form available at the service desk.  Each form can accommodate five folders, and the maximum number of requests each day is four forms.\nThe archives has a stated (and posted) policy of 30-minute service for delivering archives after they are ordered.  This is a great goal, but it is very rarely achieved.  Generally, one can expect the archives in an hour under normal circumstances.  Any tardiness or difficulty in delivery is blamed on the folks \"out back\" (\"di belakang\"), making recourse for any unfulfilled requests extremely challenging.  The most successful method is to try the request again the next day. When that does not work, there is very little that can be done, even when the staff in the reading room are on your side.\nRequests submitted in the hour before lunch (11am - 12 noon) are often lost and must be reprocessed after lunch (after 1pm).  Also, requests and document delivery are entirely closed from 12 noon - 1pm.  Requests made after 2:30pm are generally processed the next day.\n\n Photocopying, photography, microfilming\n(what are costs, permits, and page limits?  how long do you have to wait?)\n\n Key individuals\n(give names of archive staff and other individuals who can help researchers)\n\n Practicalities\n(details on food, coffee, lockers, washrooms, transportation, internet access, and the like)\n\n See also\n(links to relevant websites and resources)\n\n\n\n"

      "Archive_Info": "The provincial archive of South Sulawesi is a government institution with holdings from the Dutch, Japanese, and independence periods.  The great strengths are in local, kabupaten-level archives, although a few personal collections are also worth looking into.  This is arguably the best provincial collection in all of Indonesia, including holdings for all of Sulawesi (which until the mid-1950s was administered centrally from Makassar) and sometimes further afield in East Indonesia.\n\nContents\n\n1 Orientation\n\n1.1 Coordinates\n\n1.1.1 Address\n1.1.2 Website\n1.1.3 Telephone\n1.1.4 Fax\n1.1.5 Email\n\n\n1.2 Schedule & hours\n1.3 Working language(s)\n1.4 Directions to the archive\n\n\n2 Holdings\n\n2.1 Highlights\n\n\n3 Research procedures\n\n3.1 Access\n3.2 Permitted and prohibited items\n3.3 Document ordering and delivery\n3.4 Photocopying, photography, microfilming\n\n\n4 Key individuals\n5 Practicalities\n6 See also\n\n\n Orientation\n Coordinates\n Address\nJln.

This varies with the availability of the staff, and sometimes school groups receiving tours can fill up the reading room.  Of course, as a government office they are closed on all national holidays.  The reading room remains open during the lunch hour every day and during Friday prayers, although service for calling archives from the repository does not operate from roughly 11:30am-1pm each day, and 11:30am- 1:30 or 2pm on Fridays.  It is also difficult to get documents delivered after 2:30pm or so every day.\n\n Working language(s)\nThe archives are in both Dutch and Indonesian, as appropriate for the government of the era.  No archives are in Japanese, and regional languages are minimal.  The standard language for service is Indonesian, although a Sulawesi lilt in one's accent is appreciated.\n\n Directions to the archive\nThe archive is on the road from town out to the airport.  Blue pete-pete (angkot) labeled BTP (with a mauve stripe) or Daya (with a purple stripe) pass right in front of it.  If taking a taxi from the city center, tell the driver to pass Rumah Sakit Wahidin and then look for the Badan Arsip dan Perpustakaan Daerah on your right after one kilometer or so.\n\n Holdings\nThe archival collections here are organized first and foremost by region.  For this reason, certain collections can span the Dutch, Japanese and independence eras.  It is also worth noting that administrative regions have continually split into pieces, meaning that one archival region may split into two or three archives at a later period.  Finally, certain regions have two overlapping archival collections; the only way to differentiate them is through the collection number (not by content).\nThe following are the documentary collections, listed by their catalog number in the reading room collection:\n\n 1\tArsip Bantaeng, 1866-1973\n 2\tArsip Barru, 1920-1976\n 3\tArsip Bone, 1960-1987\n 4\tArsip Bulukumba, 1930-1960\n 5\tArsip Celebes, 1908-1945\n 6\tArsip Enrekang, 1890-1971\n 7\tArsip Gowa, 1936-1973\n 8\tArsip Gowa II, 1920-1974\n 9\tArsip Jawatan Kehutanan Wajo, 1937-1968\n 10\tArsip Jeneponto, 1910-1969\n 11\tArsip Kantor Wilayah DepAg [Department of Religious Affairs], Prop.

Sulawesi, 1946-1960\n 47\tDaftar Katalog Lontara, Rol 1-82\n 48\tDaftar Katalog Sub Dit Layanan Arsip Nasional RI\n\n Highlights\nThe provincial offices of the Kementerian Agama for Sulawesi have an archive that starts in 1947, whereas at the National Archive the Kementerian Agama collection is only listed as starting at 1972 (with a few scattered documents from earlier years).  That makes the Arsip SulSel the most complete collection for the Ministry of Religion in the Orde Lama period.\nThe South Sulawesi chapter of Muhammadiyah has also donated its archives, apparently a huge collection, to the Arsip SulSel for cataloging and preservation, but no funds have been found yet to do that cataloging.  The collection is on site, however, and it might be possible to kick-start that process if someone were so inspired.\n\n Research procedures\n Access\nResearchers can arrive and access archives same day, but in order to use the collections foreigners must first provide a copy of their national research permit.  Any foreign researcher conducting any academic research anywhere in Indonesia must enter the country on a research visa and secure a research permit (Surat Izin Penelitian) from the Indonesian Ministry of Research and Technology (MenRisTek).  For information on this process, see Research Procedures for Foreigners.\nTo use the South Sulawesi archives, researchers must also pay a Rp. 10,000 fee to use the archives (good for a period of 3 months), for which a receipt with a leges will be provided.  Be sure to get the leges (a type of notarized stamp that proves the money is going into the national treasury); sometimes the staff person in charge of leges can be out of the office, but it is wise to make sure that you get the official receipt with stamp the same day you pay.\n\n Permitted and prohibited items\nThere are no posted regulations on permitted or prohibited items, but the reading room staff do ensure that items potentially dangerous to the archives (drinks, food, and the like) are consumed at a separate table or outside.  Laptops, notebooks, ink pens, etc. seem to be absolutely fine.\n\n Document ordering and delivery\nArchival folders can be ordered as many as ten at a time, but can only be read one at a time.  After you identify the numbers you want from the catalog, submit a form to the worker on duty, who will collect them from the back in the space of roughly half an hour.  She will then hold all the folders you are not using, and give them to you one-by-one as you turn in the last one you were working on; this is to ensure that papers do not get mixed into the wrong folders and can eventually be waived if the researcher builds up sufficient trust with the staff.\n\n Photocopying, photography, microfilming\nPhotocopies cost Rp. 1000 per page (although it seems students or Indonesian citizens might pay a lower price).  They can generally be picked up the next day.  The staff can show you how to flag pages for photocopying.  Payment is made upon delivery of the copies-- and the official receipt! (This time no leges, just a normal stamp.)\n\n Key individuals\nThe head of the archives division is Ahmad Saransi, whose office is across the hall from the reading room.  He is very affable, happy both to help and to learn from researchers who visit.\n\n Practicalities\nThe archive does not require bags to be stored in lockers, just on the floor at your feet.  The reading room is air-conditioned, but positioned in the building to catch the afternoon sun, so no need to bundle up too much.\nThe archives have a canteen around back that serves classic Makassar food at very cheap prices (as of April 2010, Rp. 7000 for a very generous portion of fish, vegetables, and rice).  There are also two delicious warung just outside the gate on the right.  Those with stomachs too delicate for street food will have to ride a pete-pete for ten minutes or so to Central Mall to find something more upscale.\nThere is no wi-fi or public internet in the archives, but there is an internet cafe (named Markaz) directly across the street from the archives.  Sadly, as of October 2010 the internet cafe is still not able to print, but the connection is fast enough for everyday email needs.\n\n See also\n(links to relevant websites and resources)\n\n\n\n"

Recent acquisitions include Provident Hospital and Baltimore Symphony Orchestra records.\n\n History of the archive\nCaring for Baltimore City records has been mandated by the city charter since 1796.  The actual Bureau of Archives, under the Department of Legislative Reference, was created in 1927.  During the depression, workers with the WPA's Historical Records Survey created a complete index of records in the archives, which is still one of the tools utilized to find records today.  The position of City Archivist was created in the 1970s when a resurgence of interest in the city's past coincided with the bicentennial of the nation.  City Archivists since the creation of the position include Richard Cox, William LeFurgy, Thomas Hollowack, Rebecca Gunby, and the current acting City Archivist, Dr. Edward C. Papenfuse.  The last location of the archives before its recent move to the Waverly neighborhood was 2165 Druid Park Drive.\n\n Catalogues & finding aids\nRecords are currently being added into the Guide to Government Records.  Other online resources include the WPA-HRS Card Index and William LeFurgy's The Records of a City: A Guide to the Baltimore City Archives.  For a more comprehensive description on how to do research in the Baltimore City Archives, visit the Guide to Research in the Public Records of Baltimore City page of the Baltimore City Archives website.\n\n Languages of materials\nEnglish\n\n Restrictions & difficulties\n Classified material\n Inaccessible material\n Future of the archive\nThe Baltimore City Archives came under the wing of the Maryland State Archives in 2009 under a 5 year Memo of Understanding with the Baltimore City Government.  Currently, projects are underway to inventory the material in the warehouse, get collection descriptions online, and expand online presence by updating and expanding the functionality of the website as well as using Web 2.0 tools to bring the collections of the Archives to a broader public.\n\n Research procedures\n Access\nResearchers must present photo ID upon arrival and upon request by staff of the Baltimore City Archives or the Maryland State Archives.

The information on the registration form is subject to verification against ID presented at each visit.  Personally identifying information shall be kept secure at the Archives and will not be provided to third parties, except for officials acting under appropriate legal authority.\nThe registration form must be completed before access is granted to the search room.\n\n Permitted and prohibited items\nPermitted: Paper for research, #1 or #2 pencils, laptop computers (no bags), and cameras (video or still, digital or film), cell phones (although extensive conversation should be conducted outside the search room).\n\nProhibited: Food, beverages and beverage containers (including baby bottles, \"sippy\" cups, and other non-spillable containers), pens, permanent markers, Post-It notes, carbon paper, flatbed or handheld scanners, USB drives for insertion into Archive computers, camera or video lights, coats, jackets, sweaters with pockets, hats, briefcases, bags or purses, backpacks, belt pouches, umbrellas, boxes, bound notebooks or folders.\n\n Document ordering\nPull slips must be completed for all records using the Guide to Government Records.\n\n Ordering classified material\nRare books and manuscripts may only be used with the approval of the City Archivist.\n\n Document delivery\nNo more than three records may be used at a research desk at one time; archivists have the right to withhold records if the desk space is so crowded as to interfere with the safe handling of the records.  All material must be used on a desk or table, and must be maintained in the EXACT arrangement in which they are received.  Records may only be used by the researcher who requested them; they may not be given to other researchers in the room.  When finished, researchers are responsible for returning materials to the reference archivist.  The pull slip MUST be returned with the item.\n\n Document Handling\nAll materials must be handled with the greatest of care.  Records may not be placed on the floor.  Paper must be handled gently with two hands, and held at the edges whenever possible.  Materials MUST NOT be marked upon, altered, folded, traced, or handled in any way likely to result in damage.  Archivists may require researchers to wear gloves, which are available upon request, when handling materials.  Researchers must wash their hands before handling any materials.  Documents and volumes must lie flat on the table: they may not be propped upon other books, records, the edge of the workspace or held in the researcher's lap.\n\n Photocopying, scanning, photography\nPhotocopying is not available to the public.  Archives staff will scan requested materials and send them via e-mail in .pdf format at a suggested price of $35 for first 100 pages ($0.35 a page) and $50 for over 100 pages.  Scanning can take up to one week. Non-flash photography is permitted for personal, non-commercial use.

Marie to Marquette in 1864. Today the Bishop Baraga Association is working to canonize the celebrated \"snowshoe priest\" who came from Slovenia (the northernmost of the former Yugoslav states) to minister to native peoples on the northwoods frontier.\n\n Decades after Baraga's death, hundreds of thousands of Slovenes immigrated to the Great Lakes area and worked in mines and factories. In 1930 Slovenian-American Joseph Gregorich moved to Marquette from Oak Park, Illinois to advance Baraga's cause. His voluminous collections form the basis of the Baraga Archive, open to any researcher. To set up and appointment and learn about relevant materials to each research project, call or e-mail director Elizabeth Delene at (906) 227-9117 or edelene@dioceseofmarquette.org His letters (some 800 written by him, and 1,000 written to him) also convey a lot about Upper Peninsula life and connections with Catholic societies in Europe.

The old site, on Ticarethane street, is now used only for administration. On the new site, there are three buildings: the northwestern building contains the registration office, bathrooms, and administration. In the southeastern building, the ground floor houses computers for digital document viewing and ordering, while the upper floor is the reading room for paper documents. The northern, smallest building contains the cashier's office, for buying photocopies, as well as  bookstore for archive publications.\n\n Directions\nThe archives are housed within the Istanbul Governorate complex in Fatih.

This guide is the key to the various finding aids shelved at the back of the reading room.  Some (but not all) of these aids, in turn, have been made available in the searchable online catalogue: http://www.devletarsivleri.gov.tr/katalog/.  About ten percent of holdings are catalogued in this way, with new material added every day. \nCurrent cataloguing proceeds by provenance, according to the (changing) administrative structures of the Empire.  Previous cagalogues still in use include the Cevdet catalogue (topical, subdivided by interior, exterior, economic, and so on) and the Ali Emiri catalogue (chronological by Sultan).  Both of these catalogues are integrated into the online catalogue.  Original Ottoman classification catalogues are currently being transliterated into Modern Turkish and added to the online catalogue.\n\n Languages of materials\nMost of the material is in Ottoman Turkish, but there is a good deal of material in Arabic and French, as well as other languages.\n\n Restrictions & difficulties\n Classified material\n Inaccessible material\n Future of the archive\n Research procedures\n Access\nA passport is all that is needed, and the reader's card is delivered quickly and easily.

You fill in a form with identity information and a general description of your research topic and time period.  Bring a photograph, which will be attached to your reader's card.

You can order 25 documents per day, as well as a much smaller number of registers.\nMany documents have been digitized and can be read on the screens of computer terminals in the archive.  This collection includes 58,000 Hatt-i Humayun, 2,000 financial registers, and new material being added daily.

Lunch can be had on the sixth floor.\n\n Lockers\nThere are small lockers on the main floor. Pick up a key at the security desk.\n\n Accessibility\nThe following information comes from an H-Turk discussion about wheelchair access in March 2010:\nI think it is actually fairly accessible assuming that one gets oneself there. The archive itself is on the ground floor, perhaps a couple of steps up (there may in fact be a ramp alternative, but i am not sure). There are always attendants and security people who would be helpful in getting someone up and down these few steps if there is not a ramp. It is a closed stack system, so one looks up everything in the main room and then turns in requests to the clerk, so once you are in the main room, which is all one level, it is all accessible. There are some catalogs/indexes placed up high. Again for these, the clerks and attendants would provide help. So I would say that the situation is not ideal, but certainly very possible.\nThe metro gets one fairly close to the location of the archive. As is the case with most Turkish streets, it would be very hard, if not impossible, to navigate on a wheelchair by oneself. I would suggest a taxi from the metro stop to the archive if your student is planning to travel alone. As you might already know, the fact is that most Turkish streets are not accessible (even the parts that pretend to be accessible actually are near impossible to negotiate, ramps are usually too steep, too dangerous, curb access ramps impossible, etc.) and one can find oneself in very awkward and dangerous situations trying to navigate in a wheelchair. I would recommend a travel/research partner to accompany your student. If someone else is helping navigate the wheelchair, things would be much more doable.\nIt is also possible that the student might be able to hire someone to help him/her during his/her research in Ankara for a relatively low hourly fare. The folks at ARIT may be able provide some assistance/ideas in this and similar matters. Unfortunately, their hostel is not fully accessible (architects!), even though it has an elevator...\n(another response:)\nUnless the employees of the Basbakanlik are willing to be flexible, it will probably be quite difficult.  The new location (as of two years ago) is in a building up on a road with an incline.  It is an older building with numerous thresholds, door stoops and/or steps to manage.  I would think next to impossible for wheelchairs.  There are multiple staircases, the most important of which is a very steep one connecting the computer room (where searches/orders are made) with the reading room.  Even if perhaps the employees might agree to bring material outside the reading room to the computer room (and that is a very big if), just getting into the building would mean navigating multiple small staircases.  (And the old archive location a few blocks away, whatever services may be there, is much the same way).\n(finally this summary response from Amy Singer:)\nSecond, since I received a lot of up-to-date information on this matter, I thought it might be helpful to repost a summary for the benefit of the entire list. The postings were accompanied roughly equally by optimistic and pessimistic overall assessments, but I have tried to eliminate these in favor of as much concrete information as possible. One of the more optimistic letters came from a colleague who also uses a wheelchair.\nWhat seems to be relatively certain, however, is that there are certain logistics of moving around Istanbul which are a challenge for anyone. Arriving at the archives facility at all will require a taxi or car. Another certainty, repeated by everyone, is that the staff of the grounds (guards, etc.) and the archives together are likely to be very sympathetic and helpful to anyone arriving in a wheelchair, in particular as concerns making physical passage possible wherever realistic. (See below for details.) A few people also suggested that someone arriving in a wheelchair should probably come with an assistant, at least for the first visit and possibly for more.\n\nAccess to the location of the Archives*\n\nReading rooms of the Ba��bakanl��k Ar��ivi have been transferred to the premises of the Governor's office lately. The building is very close to the tram station; though public transportation is not easy for a person in a wheelchair in Istanbul. If one needs to access by car, he/she needs to explain the situation to the police officer on the road. They are usually helpful, though. There is no parking space, so a taxi might be more convenient. The metro gets one fairly close to the location of the archive. As is the case with most Turkish streets, it would be very hard, if not impossible, to navigate on a wheelchair by oneself. I would suggest a taxi from the metro stop to the archive if your student is planning to travel alone. As you might already know, the fact is that most Turkish streets are not accessible (even the parts that pretend to be accessible actually are near impossible to negotiate, ramps are usually too steep, too dangerous, curb access ramps impossible, etc.) and one can find oneself in very awkward and dangerous situations trying to navigate in a wheelchair.\nThe street within Bab��ali behind the main gate is laid in cobblestones, though not very coarse ones. There is a security check just behind the main gate which is easily accessible via a ramp. Then one has to cross the street to come to the archives. There are four buildings making up the public part of the archive: An administrative building where one registers, the cafeteria, another building where you pay for scans and reproductions, finally the building with the reading rooms.\n\nThe main archive building* is a 2-storey building. One must browse catalogues and use the computers for ordering documents (it's all digital), which arrive next day on the upper floor. One looks up everything in the main room on the entrance floor and then turns in requests to the clerk, so once you are in the main room, which is all one level, it is all accessible.  There are some catalogs/indexes placed up high. Again for these, the clerks and attendants would provide help.  The archival building shows signs of care for people with a wheel-chair.  It should be easy to get in the entrance hall and the ground-floor reading room with the catalogues and the intra-net computers, as from the street to these spaces all steps have been leveled by ramps. I have detected a single doorstep that has not, but it is not very high (something between 5 and 8 cm, I would reckon). Therefore, it is possible to access the catalogues and all those documents already available on-line on the intra-net almost without assistance.\n\nAccess to the cloak room and, much more importantly, to the reading room in the first floor, however, are impossible. The first is probably no big issue, the second is. The reading room is on the second floor. In order to get there one climbs a nice metal 19-century staircase, which however is very steep. It will be nearly impossible/or very dangerous for someone in a chair to get there. The main question is whether the staff would be willing to accomodate someone by bringing documents that are not yet scanned downstairs. [*I received one reply from someone who had worked on paper documents downstairs at a time when no other researchers were present and the staff were short-handed. So there does seem to be some precedent. -AS*]\n\nThe administration office* where one registers is in a separate building = more stairs. As far as I can tell, the administrative building is not accessible via wheelchair. The registration therefore would pose a problem but I imagine that G̦n�_l Han��m, who is currently in charge of the process, would be helpful. She generally is.\n\nKitap sat���� yeri/fotokopi* and *̤ay bahcesi* are very nearby in separate buildings, but yet again more stairs to get to them. The *cashier�۪s office* is not accessible with a wheel-chair.\n\nThe *cafeteria* is no problem, it is easily accessible on the ground-floor. The same holds true for the toilets, located on the ground floor of the administrative building but with a separate entrance. In the male section [*this remark from a male colleague -AS*] doors to the cabins are, however, quite narrow and none of the cabins is really spacious.\n\n Washrooms\n Transportation\n Internet access\n Funding\n Bookstore\nThere is a bookstore in the basement, in the same room where you pay photocopy fees.  A good number of publications of the archives are available here, including the Ba��bakanl��k Osmanl�� Ar��ivi Rehberi.\n\n Terminology\ndosya = box.\n\n See also\n http://www.byegm.gov.tr/statearchives/guide.htm gives information about the archives in English, and includes a number of photographs of the reading rooms and stacks.\n Christopher Markiewicz wrote an update about the Basbakanlik archives on March 15, 2013, at the Dissertation Reviews website [1].\n\n\n\n"

Yale community readers need only bring their Yale ID to register by card swipe.  New non-Yale library patrons may register onsite or pre-register online at http://beinecke.library.yale.edu/VisitorPreReg/ .  Please bring two forms of identification with recent photographs and a current address to validate your pre-registration. Undergraduates not enrolled in Yale College who are interested in manuscripts or archival collections should present a letter of introduction from their academic advisor or college librarian. Permission is required for access to some materials.\nNOTE:  Certain collections may be closed for processing.  Please consult the Closed Collections Schedule, also available from the Beinecke homepage, for a list of closed archival collections.\n\n  Online Catalogs and Finding Aids \n Orbis - Yale University Library Online Catalog. \nMay limit search to materials held by the Beinecke.\nConsider ORBIS your first stop when searching for materials held by the Beinecke. Virtually all of the Library's cataloged printed materials, as well as many of its manuscripts and archival collections can be found by searching ORBIS. You may apply various limits (location, type of material) when searching. ORBIS help screens are available.\nAn archival or manuscript collection's record in ORBIS will include a hyperlink to its corresponding finding aid in the Database of Archival Collections and Manuscripts if a finding aid is available online.\nTo find additional printed material not in ORBIS, search Uncataloged Acquisitions; for manuscripts and archival collections, search Uncataloged Acquisitions and the Database of Archival Collections and Manuscripts.\n\n Database of Archival Collections and Manuscripts - Yale University Library Finding Aids\nContains finding aids (tools known also as registers, inventories, lists, calendars, etc.) for Yale archival and manuscript collections as well as records for Medieval and Renaissance manuscripts. Finding aids provide a level of detail not found in an ORBIS catalog record, often including biographical or historical notes, a narrative description of the papers, a detailed listing of contents, and appendices with ancillary information. When retrieving finding aids in the database, be aware that some files are quite large and may require several minutes to load. Finding aids for very large archival collections (such as the Langston Hughes Papers) have been divided into separate files to ease access. Searching instructions are available.\nMultiple repositories at Yale hold archival and manuscript material. Search in ORBIS and contact other Special Collections at Yale to explore Yale's extraordinary collections.\n\n Uncataloged Acquisitions - Database of Uncatalogued Materials\nDatabase containing records with brief information for material that is not cataloged; these materials include printed, archival and manuscript material not found in ORBIS or the Database of Archival Collections and Manuscripts. In general these uncataloged materials were acquired from 1985 until the present although the database includes some earlier acquisitions. Records for cataloged material are removed annually.\n\n Digital Images Online\nDigitized materials from throughout the Beinecke Collections (over 70,000 images): photographs, manuscripts, correspondence, artwork, objects, illustrations, and selected pages from printed works. The majority of images are scans of original material in full 24-bit color. Approximately 1200 images are added every two weeks. About 20,000 images are scanned images from the Beinecke's Photonegative File, which contains negatives and color transparences of images selected for reproduction or study by patrons over the last twenty years.\nData describing these images is brief in most cases, but generally includes a call number and subject or author.\n\n Additional Stand-Alone Databases\nAmerican Drawings\nArt Storage\nCollege Pamphlets\nPapyrus Database\nWestern Collection Prints\nWestern Americana Stereocards\nWestern Americana Film Scripts\n\n Collection Summary\nThe Beinecke Rare Book & Manuscript Library is Yale University's principal repository for literary papers and for early manuscripts and rare books in the fields of literature, theology, history, and the natural sciences. In addition to its general collection of rare books and manuscripts, the library houses the Yale Collection of American Literature, the Yale Collection of German Literature, the Yale Collection of Western Americana, and the Osborn Collection. The Beinecke collections afford opportunities for interdisciplinary research in such fields as medieval, Renaissance, and eighteenth-century studies, art history, photography, American studies, the history of printing, and modernism in art and literature. Books and manuscripts at Yale have been extensively described since 1926 in the \"Yale University Library Gazette,\" which is available in many libraries.\nMore information about the Beinecke's collections may be found in the \"Overview of the Collections\" section of the Library's website: http://www.library.yale.edu/beinecke/brblinfo/brblguide.html\n\n Usage Discussion\nSuggestions for approaching the material:\nHousing and getting by for less in the area: \n\n\n  Fellowships and Funding Opportunities \nThe Beinecke provides fellowships for visiting scholars and graduate students. \nA listing of fellowships, as well as application guidelines, is available online at http://www.library.yale.edu/beinecke/brbleduc/brblfellow.html\n\n  Major Topic Areas \n\n\n"

But first, browse in the electronic catalogs, on the website (see more below).\n\n Hours and Usage Restrictions\nGeneral and Periodicals Reading Rooms: Mon.-Fri. 9AM-8PM, last request must be submitted by 7:30PM; Saturday 9AM-3PM, last request by 2:30PM.\nSpecial Collections (Rare Works, Manuscripts, Iconography): Mon.-Fri. 10AM-4PM, last request by 3:30PM.\nClosed Sundays, national holidays both fixed (such as 7 Sept.-Independence Day, Christmas day, etc.) and movable (such as Carnival, Easter, and Corpus Christi).\nAll users must check in every day at the entry desk showing ID every time (passport for foreign users), to receive a numbered badge (crach��) that must be worn in a visible place at all times while inside.  The crach�� has a magnetic spot that, when swiped over the turnstiles into various sections, opens them for one turn.  All bags and material except for paper or note cards and pencil(s) (no pens allowed) must be stored in a lock box upon entry--user keeps the key while inside.\nLaptop computers MAY be taken into the reading rooms for use in note taking, by the following procedure:  The first time at the entry desk, inform the clerk you want to use your computer to take notes.  You will receive an application form to fill out, including a description of the computer.  Take the form (but not yet the laptop) into the reading room you intend to use (serials to the left, main book reading room to the right) and submit it at the info desk for approval by the Section Head or person delegated to do so.  Take the signed form back to the locker area and retrieve your computer, and reenter the user area where the guard will ask to see both the computer and the form--keep the form with the machine, as the guard will ask you for the form when you leave.  This may seem cumbersome, but it is intended to reduce the possibility that someone might leave with someone else's computer.  The form will be dated for the duration of your research stay, so keep it with you to avoid having to go through the approval procedure again.   Never leave your computer unattended, even to go to the rest room; keep it in your possession at all times.  You will usually be able to find a place to plug in your computer's power cord--no charge for the electricity.  Rio voltage is 115v, compatible with US-voltage equipment.  US-style flat two-pronged plugs will often work in Brazilian outlets, but round two-pronged outlets are standard.  If all you have is a three-pronged (grounded) plug, you will need an adaptor, available in many Brazilian stores, including supermarkets, Lojas Americanas, or hardware stores.\nNO borrowing of anything--all use is onsite.  Also NO use of cameras, NO photocopying service, and NO reader-printers for film, only readers.  Copies of material on microfilm may be purchased by the entire roll, or selected frames may be reproduced by a digitizing service.  But this service is both time-consuming (submit your order and wait a week or more for pickup), and quite expensive.  Be prepared to take notes.\nMost of the periodicals collection is on microfilm, and nothing that is available on film may be consulted in hard copy.  \nAs of late 2007 most of the film readers had seen much use, glass lens plates are often scratched, and most are not motorized.  For some you need to request a crank at the info desk for rewinding.  Get there early and try different readers until you find one you can live with.  There are -+ 25 readers of various types and conditions.  By late morning most are in use, through the rest of the day.\nMost newspapers (on film) are in the main periodicals room, but some others are in \"obras raras\" on the 4th floor, which closes at 4PM and does not open on Saturdays.  There are fewer readers there, and several, as of late 2007, were in disrepair.\n\n  Online Catalogs and Finding Aids \nFull access to all e-catalogs is available via the website.  Do your catalog searches before departure for Brazil, and save loads of time, and learning how to use them beforehand will save time once you are onsite.  The same e-catalogs are accessible via monitors in both main reading rooms.  Some older catalogs are available on paper card files, but they were apparently transferred fairly completely to the e-versions.\n\n Collection Summary\nThe BN began with the library Jọo VI brought from Portugal in 1808, and has been accumulating items since that time.  It is supposed to function similar to the US Library of Congress, as a repository of record for all publications in Brazil, but due to variable acquisitions policies and even more variable budgetary situations over the past two centuries, the collection is not \"complete.\"  Still, it is the place to start looking for published books, and has the most complete serials (newspaper and magazine) collection for Brazilian materials in Brazil.  It is possible, however, that material not in the BN might be found at other locations in Brazil.\nThe Iconography section has considerable repository of images in various media.  The Manuscript section seems to have whatever happened to fall in the hands of the BN over the years, and does not function as an archival repository (that has been left to the Arquivo Nacional, the Arquivo da Cidade, and other specialized collections not located in the BN).\n\n Usage Discussion\nSuggestions for approaching the material:\nAlthough some of the staff may be more accommodating than others, most will be fairly knowledgeable regarding their section and how to use it.  Personalism is important:  be friendly and you will usually get friendly assistance in return.  Don't hesitate to ask questions, including any uncertainty that might arise in filling out the request form that must be submitted to the staff to retrieve any item for use.  In the main reading room you will be assigned to an individually numbered small desk, to which the items you request will be delivered.  That might take a while.  To reduce down time between items, request the second a while before you are through with the first, to give the staff time to find and deliver it.\nHousing and getting by for less in the area:\nMany (most) visiting researchers will probably find housing somewhere in the Zona Sul (Botafogo, Copacabana, etc.), and there are not many lodging options near the BN.  One exception, which I have personally used several times for short-term stays, is the Hotel Othon Aeroporto, on Av. Beira Mar across from Santos Dumont airport.  It is a quick 4 blocks or so from the BN, and is reasonable as Rio hotels go--not fancy but in a safe area, both the hotel and the walk to and from the BN.  It dates from the 1940s, but has recently been mostly refurbished.  Other hotels on the streets in Cinel̢ndia, behind the pra̤a, rent rooms mostly to couples \"by the hour\" and should be avoided.\nWherever one sleeps, it helps to be near a subway (Metr̫) station, which will get you to the BN (\"Cinel̢ndia\" station) efficiently and cheaply.\nThere is a snack bar inside the turnstiles in the BN where snacks (salgados) and drinks can do for a US-style (small) lunch.  For other meals, lunch or dinner, researchers often find one another at the Amarelinho restaurant across the Pra̤a, or the other two restaurants in that location, which specialize in traditional Brazilian restaurant fare, including feijoada on Saturday, and/or pizza (also quite Brazilian).\nMore generally, the BN, a magnificent Edwardian-era building in itself, is in a very good location for historians.  The pra̤a (formally named for Floriano Peixoto, the \"Iron Marshall\") has the BN on one side, the neo-classical City Hall on the other, the Teatro Municipal (think Paris Opera, in slightly reduced scale) at one end, and the Museum of Fine Arts on one corner, next to the BN.  The Obelisk where Get̼lio Vargas's supporters hitched their horses in 1930 is at the other end.  Two blocks down rua 13 de Maio is the largo da Carioca. . .  and the rest of historic center of the city beyond that.\n\n  Fellowships and Funding Opportunities \nNone that I know of that are sponsored by or available through the BN.\n\n  Major Topic Areas \nGeneral Brasiliana.\n\n\n\n"

Make sure to check a German calendar before planning your trip.\n\n Working language(s)\nGerman, but some of the staff speaks English. \n\n Layout\nA room with lockers is located on Ground Floor, where the reception is. However, at the time of my visit (May 2006) the reception desk was unstaffed. The reading room is situated on First Floor, stairway beside the Locker Room. The reception desk for the reading rooms is beside the stairway, left hand side. The desk is in the middle of the reading room, and divides the latter.\nThere are computers for document search and ordering, microfilm readers and shelves (where documents can be put down for later use, i.e. for the next day) in the part to the right of the desk, and the working places are to the left of the desk.\n\n Directions\nFreiburg is located on the fringes of the Black Forrest in the South-West of Germany. As the town name \"Freiburg\" and variants is not too uncommon in Germany, it is often referred to as \"Freiburg im Breisgau\" (abbrv: \"Freiburg i. Br.\" or \"Freiburg (Br.)\"), \"Breisgau\" being the name of the area.\nNearby airports include Frankfurt Int., Stuttgart Int., Karlsruhe/Baden-Baden (Baden Airpark), or the EuroAirport Basel-Mulhouse-Freiburg. Frankfurt is probably the best choice if you're coming in from overseas, whereas the other airports listed are a good choice for flights from within Europe, as they all serve low-cost airlines, like Ryanair or EasyJet.\nFreiburg is served by the A5 motorway (Frankfurt-Basel) and has a major railway station, from which fast train services (ICE etc.) depart c. every 30min.\nWithin the city an excellent public transport system is available, as Freiburg claims to be the \"greenest\" city in Germany. The Bundesarchiv is served by the bus line 11. From the Central Railway Station (German: \"Hauptbahnhof\"), take the bus (line 11) towards \"St. Georgen\" and get off at \"Schopfheimer Strasse\". From there it is just a two minute walk to the archive. Public transport vehicles in Germany often have displays inside the car that show the name of the next stop. Otherwise you might ask the bus driver, when you get on the bus, to stop there.\nFreiburg and the Freiburg area are a hotspot of tourism. Accommodation is thus not hard to find, ranging from low-budget youth hostels and guesthouses to first-class hotels. Depending on the holiday season, however, many hotels may be booked out. Accommodation can be found through hotel portals or the official Freiburg website: http://www.freiburg.de\n\n Holdings\n Description of holdings\nThe Bundesarchiv-Milit�_rarchiv is the Military Archive (Milit�_rarchiv) of the Federal Archive (Bundesarchiv) of Germany. All official documents (those that have survived) regarding the military history of Germany from the 19th century onwards are stored in this archive. Since Germany was not a unified state before the mid-19th century, but rather a commonwealth of German nations, archive material before that time is usually held in state archives elsewhere in the country.\nThe Bundesarchiv-Milit�_rarchiv therefore holds the following documents of military history:\n\n Prussian Army since 1867\n North-German Confederation\n Imperial Army\n Paramilitary Units in the Weimar Republic (Freikorps etc.)\n Reichswehr (German army in the Weimar Republic)\n Wehrmacht (German Armed Forces during the Nazi era)\n Waffen-SS\n German personnel in service for the Allies after 1945\n Armed Forces of the German Democratic Republic (Nationale Volksarmee, NVA)\n Armed Forces of the Federal Republic of German (Bundeswehr)\n Government agencies affiliated with the Armed Forces\n\nMaterial is held as paper prints or on microfilms. Photographs, sound recordings and films are also in the archive (most films are in a special film archive in the Bundesarchiv branch in Koblenz, though). The material is generally in good condition. Materials include government circulars, offical correspondence, internal correspondence, minutes of meetings, etc. Although there is a collection of materials related to personell in the German Armed Forces, these include only high-ranking persons like Ministers and Generals.\n\n History of the archive\nThe Freiburg branch of the Bundesarchiv was established in 1968. All collections regarding military history from other branches (from 1866 onwards) were transferred to it.\nMany documents have been destroyed in bomb raids and resulting fires in World War II, when the national archives were located in Berlin. This, obviously, also concerns the government agencies of the Third Reich. I.e. don't expect to find too much material from offices of that time in the archive. Also, it still remains unclear how much of the material that was bagged by Allied and Soviet troops at the end of the war was returned. Especially the Soviet government seemed not to be too keen to return documents, as much material from the Third Reich was found in archives in e.g. Moscow and Prague after the end of the Cold War. There are still negotiations underway between German and Russian agencies to return said documents.\nWhile the Milit�_rarchiv holds some photographs and other medias, most sound recordings and films are held in a special Bundesarchiv branch in the city of Koblenz. http://www.bundesarchiv.de/aufgaben_organisation/dienstorte/koblenz/index.html\nA number of documents on the military history before the 19th century are also in Koblenz.\nAs Germany was no single state before the founding of the Reich in 1871, military documents from smaller German states may reside in the respective state archives (e.g. Bavarian state archive). These are too many to list here, and it requires a good knowledge of the history of German nation building. You might contact those organizations listed under \"Scholars\" below, if you need help in tracking down documents. There are also printed archive guides for Germany available, university libraries and major archives in Germany should have copies.\nYou may also want to check the Marburg register of archives (page is in German only), which gives a list of almost all archives in Germany: http://www.archivschule.de/content/33.html\n\n Catalogues & finding aids\nComputers to access the internal document register are available in the reading room. Not all documents are stored in there yet. Printed finding aids are also available. An (incomplete) finding aid is online at: http://www.bundesarchiv.de/bestaende_findmittel/findmittel_online/online_fm_abt_ma/index.html\nDue to the peculiar ordering mechanism (see below), it is advisable to ask a member of staff for help if you can't find the documents you're looking for, or are unsure.\nThe printed finding aids are also available for purchase from an external publisher: http://www.nw-verlag.de/ (Titles: \"Findb�_cher zu Best�_nden des Bundesarchivs\" and \"Materialien aus dem Bundesarchiv\"), or can be purchased in the archive.\n\n Languages of materials\nSince the Bundesarchiv is Germany's national archive, it is not too surprising that almost all documents in the archive are in German.\n\n Restrictions & difficulties\nUntil 1945, the archive was located in Berlin. Allied bombings in the Second World War have destroyed many documents. At the end of the war, much material was bagged by Allied and Soviet troops. While most archivals have been returned later, it remains unclear whether everything has been given back to German authorities.\nThe biggest obstacle, however, that I have experienced during my stay (May 2006) was the rather chaotic catalog system. Some material is listed in the online finding aids on the web (see above). These lists are quite incomplete, though. The internal electronic catalog has more in its list, but is quite awkward to use. The printed catalog is most complete, but quite voluminous.\nThen, orders can be made through the internal electronic catalog, but you may experience difficulties, since not all material is categorized in the database, and therefore cannot be ordered through the computer system, unless you are a member of staff. You could ask the archivist to order it for you. The system, however, seemed to be incomplete or simply faulty, as some documents were marked as \"missing\" or \"on loan\" when they weren't. I came to the conclusion that ordering via the old-fashioned paper slips works best. These are available from the staff desk in the reading room, and put into a box, which is regularly checked by the archivists.\n\n Classified material\nAccording to German law, official documents are accessible by the public 30 years after their creation date. Restrictions regarding national security etc. may apply. Using newer documents requires an application in which you detail why it is vital to access the material in question.\nPersonal documents, i.e. non-official documents authored by individuals, are accessible 30 years after the person's death, or if the death date is unknown, 110 years after the person's birth.\nBy its very nature, the Milit�_rarchiv hosts a number of documents that are not accessible per se. This is yet another reason why you should get in touch with the archivists well ahead of your visit.\n\n Inaccessible material\nSome material has not been categorized yet. Searching for and ordering of these documents is therefore restricted. At times, the documents can't be ordered with the user number on your reader's ticket, but by the archivist. In case of doubt, ask a member of staff for adivse.\n\n Future of the archive\nAs the Bundesarchiv-Milit�_rarchiv is a Federal archive and thus a government agency, it is unlikely to disappear. Furthermore, the location and structure in Freiburg is not being questioned and should also remain as it is. Staffing, however, seems to be a major problem, so don't expect the best service.\n\n Research procedures\nNote: While the staff is very helpful in general, and will help you tracking down relevant documents, they won't just do anything for you. There are external research agencies available that will charge for their service. You can find a list at: http://www.bundesarchiv.de/imperia/md/content/abteilungen/abtma/recherchedienst.pdf\nIt should be noted that these researchers work on your behalf, i.e. you still need to fill out a reader's ticket application form and send it to the archive before these agencies can start to work. Can't say anything about the quality of their work. They usually offer a \"full service\", i.e. they do the complete research and copying for you. Depending on the scale of your research, it might be cheaper to let them do the work for you instead of travelling to Germany.\n\n Access\nAll natural persons are eligble to use the archive upon application. A passport for identification should be enough, but I have no experience with foreign IDs, as I am a German citizen. You should check with the archive's staff.\nUse of the archive is regulated through the German Federal Archive Law (German: \"Bundesarchivgesetz\"). The Bundesarchiv website offers a copy of it: http://www.bundesarchiv.de/benutzung/rechtsgrundlagen/bundesarchivgesetz/index.html\nAlso of relevance are the Conditions of Use of the Federal Archive: http://www.bundesarchiv.de/benutzung/rechtsgrundlagen/benutzungsverordnung/index.html, and the regulation regarding costs: http://www.bundesarchiv.de/benutzung/rechtsgrundlagen/kostenverordnung/index.html\nIn a nutshell: the Bundesarchiv is Germany's Federal Archive, i.e. a goverment agency. The archive is open to the general public (usual restrictions for public archives apply), and the usage is free of charge.\nAnybody wanting to use the archive must request a reader's ticket by filling out an application form (German: \"Benutzerantrag\"). This can be done in advance via mail or on the spot. The form is available (in German only) at: http://www.bundesarchiv.de/imperia/md/content/abteilungen/abtg/g1/117.pdf\nApart from that, it is mandatory to write to the archive (e-mail or postal) and explain your intention of research. This helps the staff to prepare your visit and reserve a place for you in the reading room. While sending the application form in advance is not required, this message to the archive is. You won't get access without anouncing your visit and your intended research in advance. Furthermore, places in the reading room are limited (c. 20), and the reading room might already be booked out for the period you intend to stay. Contacting the archive is therefore also required to book a working place.\nFrom personal experience, I highly recommend to correspond with the archivists ASAP. The archive is not staffed very well (in terms of quantity), but the staff is generally very helpful. I would advise to track down as many document numbers as possible and let the staff know what you want to look at beforehand, or ask the archivists via e-mail if they can track down relevant documents for you. I experienced a number of difficulties when ordering documents I hadn't pre-booked, as some documents were on loan in-house at the time and not available in short time. Also, at the time of my visit (May 2006), there was some confusion in regard to the ordering system and inventory system, which resulted in a document that took one week to be found in the storage rooms.\n\n First visit\nAs you are obliged to introduce yourself and your intended research in mails before your visit (see above), all that needs to be done is filling out the application form for the reader's ticket. Your ticket is issued immediately, and since you were supposed to book at least some material in advance in said mails (and a seat being reserved for you), you can start right-away.\n\n Permitted and prohibited items\nPermitted: Laptop Computers, Pens, Pencils, Paper, Notebooks\nProhibited: Cameras, Scanners, Phones\n\n Document ordering\nDocuments can be requested through the internal computer system or with paper slips. The latter is recommended, as the former does not appear as mature (see below). As outlined above, pre-ordering material is also advised. Usually, up to ten files can be pre-ordered. This seems also be the limit in regard to the number of documents you can use at a time. There seems to be no limit on the number of documents you can order at one time, though, just on the number of documents you can work with in the reading room.\n\n Ordering classified material\nAccessing classified material requires an (informal) written application to the archive, in which you detail your research and why you need to access the material in question. As I have never required such access, I am unsure about the procedure. It would be best practice to get in touch with the archive and inquire about the steps necessary to get access, I think.\n\n Document delivery\nDelivery time varies, but is usually 30min. As mentioned, the cataloging system seems to be immature, which caused some confusion among the archivist and led to lengthier delivery times, the longest time for a file to be delivered was five days. Pre-ordering your documents might help, but you have to get in touch with the archivist to make sure the document is available, as you usually don't get feedback on your order.\nSee above in regard to the number of items that can be consulted at a time.\nDocuments you are finished with are put on a tray, which is regularly collected by an archivist for re-shelving. If you want to use a file over several days, you can put it onto a special shelf in the reading room (near the microfilm readers) and pick it up from there the next day.\nIn case you want to order reproductions (see below) you can get a \"bookmark\" from the archivist which you are supposed to put in the file. The file is put on the tray as usual, but the bookmark indicates to the archivist not to re-shelf it.\n\n Photocopying, photography, microfilming\nTaking photographs is not allowed. There is no photocopier in the reading room. Documents on microfilms can be printed out in the reading room directly (sometimes there are both microfilms and hardcopies of the same document available, check with the archivist). All other reproductions need to be ordered. The ordering forms are available in the reading room (or online: http://www.bundesarchiv.de/imperia/md/content/abteilungen/abtg/selke_bestellformular.pdf). However, the reproduction is made by the private company Selke. They offer a broad range of services, including scans on CD-ROM. Current prices and conditions can be found at: http://www.bundesarchiv.de/imperia/md/content/abteilungen/abtg/merkblatt-euro_2007_.pdf\nSelke usually operates on an invoice basis. I don't know how they handle orders from non-German residents. Selke has an employee sitting in the Freiburg archive: Mrs. Sch̦neberger, phone: +49-761-47817908. The archivists will also be able to give details about the service. Usually, you put a marker in the file to indicate to the archivist that a reproduction is being requested (so the staff puts it aside, and not back into the storage room), then you fill out the ordering form, give it to the archivist, and some weeks later (duration varies) you'll receive the copies via mail.\n\n Key forms\nThe only key form would be the application form for the reader's ticket: http://www.bundesarchiv.de/imperia/md/content/abteilungen/abtg/g1/117.pdf\n\n Key individuals\n Archive staff\nIn general, persons working in the public sector in Germany are sometimes hard to deal with. Staff in the Bundesarchiv are very friendly and helpful, but bureaucracy and inefficiency are also encountered (as in any government agency) and can be a pain at times. While I was there, the archivist (forgot the name, a middle-aged lady with a stern look) was extremely helpful, as she seemed to know just every document in the archive. Given the somewhat chaotic cataloging system (see above), her services proved invaluable, since she could sort out most issues in no time.\n\n Scholars\nThe material held in the archive is quite broad, to say the least. Therefore, there is hardly a person who knows all the stuff in there. There is, however, a history department at the Bundeswehr (German Armed Forces) dedicated to the military history of Germany, the \"Milit�_rgeschichtliches Forschungsamt\" (Military History Research Institute). It is located in Potsdam near Berlin, but has an office in Freiburg, too, as the department has no archive itself and has to use the one in Freiburg.\nTheir website is accessible at http://www.mgfa.de/, through which contacts can be made. It is likely that they can direct you to a person  of interest to your research.\nThe \"Deutsches Historisches Museum\" (German Historical Museum) in Berlin also has a renowned study group in military history, the \"Arbeitskreis Milit�_rgeschichte\" (Military History Study Group): http://www.akmilitaergeschichte.de/, which functions also as scientific society (incl. annual conferences).\n\n Bibliography\nToo many to list here. Basically, all publications related to aspects of military history of Germany use material from this archive.\nThe Bundesarchiv itself also releases publications. Contact them to get a list.\n\n Practicalities\n Food\nThere is no cantina in the archive building, only a vending machine on First Floor. However, the area of Freiburg where the archive is located is a commercial one, there are supermarkets and smaller restaurants in the vicinity. Food in the reading room is not permitted. There is a break room adjacent to the reading room (where the aforementioned vending machine is located), in which food can be consumed.\n\n Lockers\nLockers are available on Ground Floor, taking a 1 Euro coin as refund.\n\n Washrooms\nRestrooms are available on First Floor, adjacent to the reading room and break room.\n\n Transportation\nSee above section \"Directions\".\n\n Internet access\nNone.\n\n Funding\nThe archive itself offers no funding. Depending on the kind of research you may find other sources. Check the webpage of the German Academic Exchange Service: http://www.daad.de/en/index.html\n\n Bookstore\nNone.\n\n See also\nPlease see Gil-li Vardi's \n\ndescription from Archives Made Easy.\n\n\n"

Materials relate to the modern history of European countries affected by the Holocaust; the history of fascism; racial prejudice and anti-Semitism; genocide and issues related to the world response to genocide; the study of victims of racial and political prejudice; the development of various types of concentration camps; the study of child victims; Jewish responses to the Holocaust; Holocaust-related art, literature, and theology; and the personal recollections of victims. The library also has a major collection of Yizkor (memorial) books that preserve the memory of families and cultural life of many communities destroyed during the Holocaust.\nThe Archives of the USHMM contains over 40 million pages of textual records on a wide range of subjects pertaining to the Holocaust, its origins, its implementation, and its aftermath. Examples of the types of documentation maintained in the archives are the records of Jews and Jewish organizations in Germany, Austria, and elsewhere; Romanian records relating to the murder of Jews and Roma in Transnistria; records of the SS and police leaders in the Lublin District (occupied Poland); records of the postwar Soviet trials of key SS officials; major collections from various archives and ministries in Croatia, Belgium, France, Bulgaria, and the Netherlands; and wartime records relating to the activities of the Einsatzgruppen operating in Latvia and Belarus. The archives also contains materials on the fate of the Roma (Gypsies) and Jehovah�۪s Witnesses, camp and ghetto music and lyrics, etc. A searchable Archival Guide is available on the museum�۪s web site.\nThe Photo Archive is a full-service research archive as well as the repository for historical still photography within the USHMM. It currently holds more than 70,000 images. Over 80 percent of this collection is in digitized format. An online database is available for visitors to the photo archive. Over 1,000 public domain photographic images are available for viewing on the museum�۪s web site. The photo archive can reproduce materials that are owned by the USHMM or available in the public domain. Fees are limited to the cost of reproduction.\nThe Oral History Department collects and produces video- and audio-taped testimonies of Holocaust survivors, rescuers, liberators, resistance fighters, prosecutors, perpetrators, and bystanders.

The ICOS contains records for unpublished source materials in the Niels Bohr Library archives and over 700 other repositories worldwide. The period of interest is chiefly from about 1890 to the present, but the ICOS also contains information on 19th-century collections of interest, and even earlier ones of major importance. In addition to collections that are in libraries and archives, the ICOS has information on papers in private hands (especially if they are available for research use) and information on papers of significant scientists that have been destroyed. The library also maintains the Physics History Finding Aids web site, which provides access to finding aids for more than 100 collections at 12 major science archives.\n\n\n Usage Discussion\nSuggestions for approaching the material:\nHousing and getting by for less in the area:\n\n\n\n"

These include older sheet music, scores, song books and hymnals from the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries; a collection of performance documents including posters, playbills and programs; historic photographs; and music industry trade catalogs. Research in vernacular religious music is supported through a collection of southern gospel songbooks, 19th century oblong songbooks, New England hymnody, shape note music, Sunday school songs, Negro spirituals, African-American gospel and denominational hymnals. Manuscript collections of personal papers and other unique materials are available with staff assistance.  \nIn addition, the Center holds 170,000 sound recordings in all formats. The collection covers all aspects of American vernacular music, both secular and sacred, from early 78 rpm recordings to current compact discs. A small percentage of the collection is cataloged, but most items must be located by referring to discographies.  Staff assistance is provided.\n\n Usage Discussion\nSuggestions for approaching the material:\nHousing and getting by for less in the area: \n\n\n  Fellowships and Funding Opportunities \n  Major Topic Areas \nThe Center's collection documents the diversity of American music and our national vernacular culture. From the 18th to early 20th century music was disseminated largely in printed form: sheet music, songsters, broadsides, instrumental instruction books and song anthologies. After 1920 recorded sound gained dominance. The Center's collection reflects this change in the commodification of music.  \nThe Center recognizes the interplay between musical styles in American culture by providing study-level collections in all genres. Rather than duplicating the collection depth in specialized archives, the Center strives to support local research needs in all genres while providing research-level collections in specific areas: rock & roll and its roots, the various forms of vernacular religious music, and music of Tennessee and the Southeast.\n\n\n\n"

It collects two- and three-dimensional materials pertaining to the social, cultural, economic, and political history of metropolitan Cincinnati, the Miami Purchase, and the Old Northwest Territory. Specifically, the society may collect materials relating to the settlement, agriculture, business and industry, transportation, communication, science and technology, the arts, domestic life, education, religion, politics, wars, ethnic groups, neighborhoods, and other aspects of the history of Cincinnati and the surrounding region.\nThe Archives division contains over 2,500 major and 4,000 smaller collections including the personal papers and records of early settlers, lawyers, politicians, artists, and businessmen and the records of civic, educational, cultural, political, social, and financial settlement. Papers of 20th-century politicians include those of Murray Seasongood, Nicholas Longworth III, Joseph Benson Foraker, Charles P. Taft II, and John B. Hollister. Company records, ledgers, catalogs, as well as products relate the talents of Cincinnati�۪s 19th-century craftsmen. Immigrants and ethnic groups are represented, as well as local businesses, from Miles Greenwood�۪s Eagle Iron Works (an important munitions manufacturer during the Civil War) to the records of the machine tool and heavy industries of the late Industrial Revolution for which Cincinnati has become world famous.\nMore than six million feet of film, videotapes, and sound recordings are housed in Audiovisual Collections. The collection, acquired by donation from individuals and Cincinnati television and radio stations over the past 50 years, includes newsreel film, radio broadcasts from the 1930s and 1940s, and television programming from the past four decades.\nThe Photograph Collection includes approximately one million images that document the history of the city. The work of many prominent Cincinnati photographers is represented in the collections of daguerreotypes, ambrotypes, tintypes, glass lantern slides, postcards, early and modern prints, glass and film negatives, and slides. The work of photographers J. B. Ball, Paul Briol, Daniel J. Ransohoff, Felix Koch, and George S. Rosenthal is represented. The records of the advertising studio, Marsh Photographers, Inc., have been given to the society; businesses such as Kelly Auto Body and Palm Brothers Decalcomania have donated images of their products. Photographs of the Windisch, Carson, and Robinson families are representative of the many family portraits in the collection.\nApproximately 80,000 drawings, blueprints, and renderings of over 50 19th- and 20th-century Cincinnati architectural firms are contained in the Architectural Records Collection. Also included in this important collection are office files, specifications, scrapbooks, and the records of the Cincinnati Chapter of the American Institute of Architects.\nIn addition to standard reference works for the study of U.S. and Cincinnati history, the Printed Works division consists of approximately 40,000 books, 50,000 pamphlets, 140 newspaper titles, 350 broadsides, 300 periodical subscriptions, and a collection of ephemera. More than 2,500 maps record the development of the eastern United States, the Old Northwest Territory, Ohio, and Cincinnati. The Printed Works Collection is especially strong in the representation of 18th- and 19th-century accounts of visitors to the region and city, and the history of 19th- and 20th-century politics and educational and social institutions.\nThe library also contains an important print collection with over 800 items from Hennegan & Co. and 1,000 posters from the Strobridge Lithographing Company. Items include circus, theater, and festival posters.\nTo access the library�۪s online catalog, go to http://library.cincymuseum.org. The Library Catalog contains over 29,900 records with information about books, pamphlets, newspapers, photographs, maps, and manuscript collections. The catalog also contains an inventory of Ohio Civil War monuments, the Guide to 20th Century African American Resources, and 20,000 pages of history and science journals published by the Cincinnati Museum Center (CMC). The journals are word searchable. \nThe Preservation Department conducts a comprehensive preservation program designed to maintain the collections in useable condition. As part of the preservation program, the department conducts environmental monitoring, emergency/disaster planning for the collections, collections maintenance activities, staff training, conservation treatment, and exhibit support. The Preservation Department includes an in-house conservation treatment laboratory and a preservation microfilming operation.\nThe History Museum collection contains three-dimensional products from the city�۪s 19th- and 20th-century manufacturing industries, including furniture, machine tools, brewing implements, and printing equipment. Local transportation history is represented by steamboat, automotive, and railroad objects with original items from Cincinnati Union Terminal. The collection also includes decorative arts, textiles, and costumes. Fine art consists of prints by the Hennegan and Strobridge companies as well as works by artists Henry Mosler, Robert Duncanson, Elizabeth Nourse, Hiram Powers, and Edward T. Hurley.\n\n\n Usage Discussion\nSuggestions for approaching the material:\nHousing and getting by for less in the area:\n\n\n\n"

Of particular note are City Council minutes, by-laws and records of election. Although public records are primarily textual in nature, maps, plans and photographs are also represented.\nRoughly half of the Archives' holdings are records from non-government sources documenting the social, political, economic, cultural and community life of Vancouver. These include donations from pioneer families, politicians, social activists, artists, entrepreneurs and community organizations. The records are primarily textual, but also include photographs, architectural drawings, maps, plans, audio, moving images, and documentary art.\nThe Archives' photograph collection is comprised of more than one million images from private and public records. These photographs depict a wide range of subjects relating to Vancouver's history and culture from the 1860s to the 1980s. They bring to life the social, cultural and economic realities of the city's past, as well as the everyday activities of generations of its citizens.\n\n History of the archive\n(previous location(s) of collection held there, and any information that might help researchers to navigate previous systems)\n\n Catalogues & finding aids\nSearch all holdings: http://searcharchives.vancouver.ca/\nAdvanced Search: http://searcharchives.vancouver.ca/;search/advanced\nOnline search provides access to audiovisual content, both streaming and downloadable\n\nFinding Aid for discovering home history\nFinding Aid for genealogy research\n\n Languages of materials\n Restrictions & difficulties\n Classified material\nResearchers have to fill out an access permission form for accessing restricted records.

The division files and maintains land records and other contracts recorded in Orleans Parish. Records dating from 1733 to 1970 are housed in the Research Center, while records dating from 1910 to the present are housed in the Filing office.  The Notarial Archives Division continues to preserve the valuable documents under its care and to make them accessible to the legal community, the academic research community, architectural historians, genealogists, and to the general public at large.  In addition to text-based documents, the division holds thousands of \"Plan Book Drawings\" created during the 19th century by civil engineers, surveyors and architects. Early plans may be in ink and water color on paper or ink on cloth.  The division additionally houses all surveys and plans which accompany acts.\n\nContents\n\n1 Orientation\n\n1.1 Coordinates\n\n1.1.1 Address and Contact Information\n1.1.2 Website\n1.1.3 Email\n\n\n1.2 Schedule & hours\n1.3 Working language(s)\n\n\n2 Holdings\n3 Finding Aids\n4 Research procedures\n\n4.1 Access\n4.2 Permitted and prohibited items\n4.3 Document ordering and delivery\n4.4 Photocopying, photography, microfilming\n\n\n\n\n Orientation\n Coordinates\n Address and Contact Information\nFiling Office:    1340 Poydras Street Suite 500  New Orleans, LA  70112\n Telephone: 504-568-8577\n Fax:  504-599-1443\n\nResearch Center:  1340 Poydras Street Suite 360  New Orleans, LA  70112\nTelephone:  504-680-9604\nFax:   504-680-9607\n\n Website\nNotarial Archives Division -  http://www.notarialarchives.org/\nCivil District Clerk of Court -  http://www.orleanscdc.com/\n\n Email\ninfo@notarialArchives.org\nnotarialarchivesdivision@orleanscdc.com\n\n Schedule & hours\nThe Filing Office and the Research Center are open from 8:30am to 5:00pm Monday through Friday.  \nThe Filing Office is open for research and copy requests only, from 7:00am to 8:30am and 5:00pm to 6:00pm Monday through Thursday and from 7:00am to 8:30am on Friday.\nOffices are closed for holidays.\n\n Working language(s)\nThe majority of holdings are in English, though a portion of the records housed in the Research Center are in French or Spanish.\n\n Holdings\nFiling Office: Approximately 1900 to the present\nRecords created after July 28, 1970, are retrieved by their NA (Notarial Archives) number. NA numbers are clearly marked on the spines of the record books. Land transfers and some other record types are indexed by the Register of Conveyances. Encumbrances on property are indexed by the Recorder of Mortgages.\nRecords created prior to July 28, 1970, are retrieved by the name of the notary and the date of the act. If researchers do not have the NA number (after 1970) or the notary�۪s name and date (before 1970), they may consult the Register of Conveyances electronic and paper indexes. Notary names and dates appear on the spines of the record books. Annual indexes are also bound into the volumes.\nSome pre-1970 notary records are bound in ���various notaries�۝ volumes that date back to 1902. \nAll documents (including attachments) are open to the public.\nResearch Center:\nRecords date from 1733 to 1970, during the time of Civil Law notarial practice when notaries archived their own records. The records are arranged the way they were created ��� by notary and then by date. Annual indexes maintained by the notaries are bound into their volumes.\nBecause New Orleans was once a  French and a Spanish colony, records prior to the Louisiana Purchase (1803) are in French or Spanish. After the Louisiana Purchase, many 19th century records continued to be written in French. English eventually replaced French as the language of choice later in the century.\n\nIn addition to textual records, tens of thousands of which contain site surveys, the Research Center houses thousands of oversize watercolor architectural drawings of 19th century properties known as Plan Book plans.\n\n Finding Aids\nWhile there is no comprehensive index to the records, a companion office to the Notarial Archives, the Conveyance Division, maintains party-name indexes to property transfers back to 1827. The Conveyance indexes are annual, and are divided into \"Vendor (seller)\" and \"Purchaser.\" The Conveyance indexes are extremely useful in locating notaries ��� essential data in accessing notarial records created before 1970.\n\nOther useful research tools include indexes of family records, 1770-1840, created by genealogist Charles R. Maduell, Jr.; a building-contract index, 1767-1970, created by Samuel Wilson and Robert J. Cangelosi, Jr.; and a corporate-charter index, 1852-1904, all of which are available at the Research Center.\nSee the Research Center and Historical Documents page (http://www.notarialarchives.org/research.htm) for more resources.\n\n Research procedures\n Access\nAll documents are available for public access.  Patrons must register at the desk in the Research Center upon arrival.\n\n Permitted and prohibited items\nPatrons are permitted to bring laptops, pencil, paper and cellular phones into the repository.  No photographs are allowed.  Photocopies or digital images can be provided for a fee.\n\n Document ordering and delivery\nDocuments can be requested by phone, letter or email.  Documents can be delivered by mail or fax.  Please see website for fee schedule or call for more information.\n\n Photocopying, photography, microfilming\nPhotocopying is available for a fee, see website for fee schedule.  \nDocuments in the Filing Office can be copied on a photocopier.

The computerized catalogues in the manuscript room are less reliable than the card catalogue and the catalogues in books.\nHousing and getting by for less in the area: \nThe Dar al-Kutub is on the Corniche on the downtown side.  There are minibuses from Maidan Tahrir (accessible by metro) but, if you're anywhere in central Cairo, it's not expensive to take a cab.  If the cab driver doesn't know the Dar al-Kutub (many do), the Conrad Hotel is next door and most drivers know that.\n\n  Fellowships and Funding Opportunities \n  Major Topic Areas \n\n\n"

The largest is the document reading room on the east side of the second floor.  It contains thirty desks and half a dozen microfilm readers, as well as catalogues.  There is also a library (containing some books and copies of theses) and a printed materials reading room (containing valuable material on open shelves) [see separate entries?].\nDocuments are stored in the basement of the archive building.\n\n Directions\n Holdings\n Description of holdings\n(a more extensive description (qualitative and/or quantitative) of the holdings and the state in which they are kept)\n\n History of the archive\n(previous location(s) of collection held there, and any information that might help researchers to navigate previous systems)\n\n Catalogues & finding aids\n(describe any that exist, and give links to any that are online)\n\n Languages of materials\nAlthough this archive holds a good deal of material in Ottoman Turkish and in European languages, those who do not read, write, and speak some Arabic will have much difficulty accessing it.\n\n Restrictions & difficulties\n Classified material\n Inaccessible material\n Future of the archive\nThe national archives is in the process of creating a digital catalogue of its entire collection.  The complete database will be online in September 2009.\n\n Research procedures\n Access\nReaders must apply to the Egyptian government for research permission; approval can take many months.  Applications and instructions can be had from the reading room staff.  It is preferable, however, to apply via a research institution in Egypt or with the assistance of an Egyptian scholar.  Those visiting Egypt to conduct research should apply (and receive a reader�۪s card) before travelling.  John Dunn's comments on this topic at Archives Made Easy are helpful.\n\n First visit\nLeave passport or identity card at the security desk at the main door on arrival, and collect a numbered reader�۪s tag.  Leave all bags in the locker room near the cafe.\nLeave reader�۪s pass with reading room staff on arrival (and collect it on departure).\n\n Permitted and prohibited items\nPermitted: laptop computers, dictionaries, cellular telephones, ink pens.\nProhibited: Digital cameras.\n\n Document ordering\nDocuments are typically ordered in consultation with reading room staff (see key individuals below).  Enter the document information (in Arabic) on an order slip, using carbon paper to make a second copy.  Traditionally, readers put the carbon paper in place for the next order.  It is not uncommon for documents to be unavailable (often for long periods of time) because they are in restoration (tarmim).\n\n Ordering classified material\nThere is no formal procedure in place governing access to classified material.\n\n Document delivery\nOne can order three items per day.  Documents are normally delivered around 9:30 on the morning after they are ordered, although under certain circumstances and for certain individuals, delivery can be almost instantaneous.  Volumes and boxes are kept on shelves behind the reading room staff.  Readers typically collect the material themselves, entering the name of the item they consult in a ledger.\n\n Photocopying, photography, microfilming\nPhotocopying is performed by archive staff.  One must write a request addressed to the director of the archives, listing the material to be copied.  Here is a suggested format for the request:\n\n\n�����_�_�� / �ɯ��_�� ������ �������ǯ��_�� �����������_��\n\t�����¯��� �������������⯩ �_���� �������_��\n(name of document)\n���ɯ_���_�� ���_������ ���㯱�_����\n\t\t\t\t\t\t����������\n(your name)\n(the date)\n\nThis letter and the original are given to the reading room staff, who will carry the items to the photocopy room.  Once the copies are made, the reader must go to the basement to pay for the copies (2.5 LE per page).  Copies are collected from the photocopy room in exchange for the receipt for payment.  The quality of photocopies is usually excellent, but the process can be terrifyingly damaging to the originals.  Most research permits entail a 100 or 200 copy limit, though staff has been known to show flexibility.  \nPhotography is strictly prohibited.\n\n Key forms\n(what are the main forms that the archive uses? if possible, provide links to copies or post copies directly)\n\n Key individuals\n Archive staff\nMadame Nadia Mustafa.  Head of reading room staff.  Can be very helpful in locating material and arranging research.\nMadame Nagwa Mahmud.  Deputy head of reading room staff.  She is in charge when Madame Nadia is absent.\nDr. ���Emad Helal.  Director of Documentary Research Unit.  Historian, and head of archive cataloguing project.  Broad knowledge of archival holdings.  Has a great desire to improve access to documents.  Speaks English.\nDr. Muhammad Sabr ���Arab: director of National Library and Archives.\nDr. Rifa'at Helal: director of National Archives.\nAl-'Amid Sami al-Zayyat.  Director of security.  Watches readers through a bank of closed-circuit cameras from office on north side of second floor.\nTaha.  Head of main door security desk.  Friendly and thorough.\nRami Tala'at.  Finance administrator of cataloging project.\n\n Scholars\n(scholars who are familiar with this archive)\n\n Bibliography\n(published works based on research at this archive)\n\n Practicalities\n Food\nThe cafe outside the reading room is impossible to miss.  Sharing tea, coffee, lemonade, and conversation with other readers is a great pleasure of this archive.  Hospitality is overwhelming, and it is very difficult for a non-Egyptian to pay for his or her own coffee.  Sandwiches and cookies are available.\nThe Conrad hotel, next to the archives, contains expensive and mediocre cafes and restaurants.  A mall several hundred metres north on the corniche contains a number of restaurants, including a branch of the Danish sandwich shop.\nMore affordable eating (ful and ta�۪miya) can be had in the popular neighbourhood behind the archive.\n\n Lockers\nAll bags must be checked in a room on the second floor of the archive.\n\n Washrooms\nMen�۪s and women�۪s bathrooms are located on the second floor.  No soap or toilet paper is provided, so bring your own if so inclined.\n\n Transportation\nBusses and taxis are always available just outside the front door of the archive.  To get there, ask taxi drivers for ���Dar al-Kutub�۝ on the Corniche.\n\n Internet access\n Funding\n Bookstore\nA glass box between the entrances to the national library and the national archives sells a useful range of books published by the institution, including many reproductions of documents.  Prices are very reasonable.  There is also a ���permanent book fair�۝ beneath the national library, where many useful books can be had.\n\n Other\n Useful vocabulary\n���_���_�� = rebinding\n�������_�� = restoration\n\n See also\n[John Dunn's entry] on this archive at Archives Made Easy\n\nFor more information on this and other archives in Africa, please see Africa Research Central.\n\n\n\n"

No newspaper collection; selected newspaper articles appear throughout the manuscript holdings, filed with the appropriate mission. The periodicals \"Vincentian Heritage\" and \"Annals of the Congregation of the Mission\" are available for research. The manuscript  collections measure approximately 12,000 linear feet, inclusive dates from 1809 to the present. Materials include brochures, pamphlets, letters, diaries, newspaper articles, and Provincial Annals. Subjects covered include the charity, nursing, social work and teaching missions of the Daughters of Charity; the community�۪s work during natural disasters, epidemics, and armed conflicts such as the Civil War, the Spanish-American War, and World Wars I and II; lives of community saints and leaders; history of the Catholic Church in the United States, especially in areas where Daughters of Charity have been present; history of women religious in the United States; women�۪s higher education. Photographs include images of missions, organized by mission. Photos of individual Sisters are housed with files on those Sisters.\n\n Research procedures\n Access\nOpen to researchers 18 years of age and older.\nResearchers must present photo identification on their first visit and fill out a registration form. Acceptable identification: Driver's license or government-issued ID card, passport, or school ID. \nLetters of reference not required. \n\n Permitted and prohibited items\nPermitted: Personal computers may be used for note taking. If taking notes on paper, notes must be taken in pencil, on loose leaf paper that we provide. Cell phones may be brought into the Reading Room, but we ask that they be turned off so as not to disturb other researchers. Personal cameras may be used to photograph materials - no flash permitted and only ambient light. Pre-written notes must be on loose paper (not on a pad or in a notebook).  \nProhibited: Pens and highlighters are not allowed, nor are pressure sensitive notes, such as Post Its. *Prohibited: No food, drink, or smoking is permitted in the Reading Room. Researchers must leave personal belongings in one of the free, secure lockers located opposite the information desk. This includes coats, bags, carrying cases, briefcases, purses, books, mp3 players, personal copiers and scanners, notebooks, and notepads.\nComplete policies and forms are available at: http://dcarchives.wordpress.com/researchers/\n\n Photocopying, photography, microfilming\nPhotocopies: 50 cents per page. \nScanning: $10 per image \nWe do not offer microfilming.\nNo public access Internet terminal; WiFi is available. \nSee http://dcarchives.wordpress.com/researchers/ for  more information.\n\n Key individuals\nDenise Gallo, Ph.D., Provincial Archivist \nCarole Prietto, CA, Associate Archvist\n\n Practicalities\nTransportation: Emmitsburg is in a rural area. A personal car is essential, as there is no public transportation that goes to Emmitsburg. We cannot provide transportation for researchers.\nAccommodations: Onsite accommodations are not available. A nearby place to stay is: Sleep Inn, 501 Silo Hill Pkwy, Emmitsburg, MD, 21727; phone: (301) 447-0044. Restaurants, a grocery store, a PNC Bank ATM, and a gas station are located along Silo Hill Road, close to the Sleep Inn.\nFood service: We do not have onsite food service, but many food options are available in town, close to the campus. Staff can provide information on these. Researchers are welcome to bring lunch and store it in a locker; food must be eaten outside of the archives. Food and drink (including water) are not permitted in our reading room. \nLockers: Lockers for storing coats, suitcases, and other items are located in the lobby opposite the information desk. There is no charge for using the lockers. If you need a locker, let the front desk staff know and keys will be issued. Lockers should be emptied and locker keys returned at the end of each day. \nResearchers will be issued a visitor badge each day. The badge is needed to move about the building. The  badge is necessary because St. Joseph House is home to a variety of different functions in addition to the Provincial Archives: local communities of Daughters of Charity, nursing care facilities, and the National Shrine of Saint Elizabeth Ann Seton. The level of visitor access to these areas varies, and most doors within the building are controlled by card access. If you need to leave the building during the day please return your visitor badge to the staff on your way out; we will return the badge to you when you come back. Badges will be collected at the end of the day. \nAccommodations for persons with disabilities: The Provincial Archives is committed to making its collections, services, and public programs accessible to persons with disabilities. Researchers who \nrequire assistance in using our collections should contact the Archives at 301-447-6041 or archives@doc.org in advance of their visit. We will be happy to assist you in any way we can.\n\n See also\nFor an overview of our collections, see: Religion Collections in Libraries and Archives:  A Guide to Resources in Maryland, Virginia, and the District of Columbia (published by the Library of Congress).  http://www.loc.gov/rr/main/religion/charity.html\n\n\n\n"

No appointment is needed to visit the Library or use its collections.\nThe Library is open for research Monday through Friday, 9:00 am until 5:00 pm, Central Time. Researchers can request a Saturday appointment by contacting the Library beforehand. The Library is closed on New Year�۪s Day, Memorial Day, Fourth of July, Labor Day, Thanksgiving, Christmas Eve, and Christmas Day. It is also closed for the Battle of Flowers Parade (April 15, 2011).\nFor more information about visiting the DRT Library - including information about registration procedures, permitted and prohibited items, and access rules - please see the ���Library Use Guidelines�۝ page on our website at http://www.drtl.org/Research/LibraryGuidelines.asp.\nWith the exception of some ready-reference Texas genealogical materials, the DRT Library is a closed-stacks library; staff members generally retrieve materials requested by patrons. All of the library�۪s collections are stored on-site and can be retrieved quickly. Resources cannot be checked out from the library, nor can they be requested via interlibrary loan.\nWritten and telephone requests are welcome. Please make requests for information as specific as possible. Users requesting that copies be mailed to them will be sent an invoice for the cost of the copies plus mailing costs and tax.\nPhotoduplication of archival materials is provided if copying can be done without causing injury to the item and without conflicting with donor agreements or copyright restrictions. Fees are twenty cents for letter-size copies, twenty-five cents for legal-length copies, and thirty cents for document or ledger size copies (11 x 17 inches). With some exceptions, photocopies can usually be made on the same day of a patron�۪s visit. Copies must be paid for with cash or a check.\nFor information about ordering reproductions of photographs, including policies and fees, please see the Library�۪s website at http://www.drtl.org/Contact/Rights&Repro_Gen.asp.\nPatrons are not allowed to use personal digital cameras or scanners to create digital copies of library and archival materials.\n\n Online Catalogs and Finding Aids\nAll processed archival collections are represented in the DRT Library's online catalog. \nFinding aids have been created for all large processed collections. Those available online can be accessed through the catalog and through browse by title and browse by subject pages on the Library's website. Finding aids are also being added to the Texas Archival Resources Online (TARO) website; as of April 2011, approximately one-fourth of the Library's finding aids can be accessed there. Paper copies of all finding aids are available in the library�۪s reading room and can be used by on-site patrons. Off-site patrons can receive an electronic or paper copy of a finding aid not available online by contacting the archivist.\nImages in the library�۪s photograph collection are accessed in different ways, depending on where they are housed. Photographs that are part of a processed manuscript collection are described in the collection�۪s catalog record and/or finding aid. Other photographs are contained in the library�۪s picture file; some of these images have been described individually in unique MARC records.\nThe National Union Catalog of Manuscript Collections, maintained by the Library of Congress, lists 246 of the library�۪s manuscript collections. Collections acquired since 2004 are not included in this catalog. The DRT Library is in the process of getting all MARC records for its library and archival materials included in OCLC�۪s WorldCat catalog.\n\n Collection Summary\nThe Daughters of the Republic of Texas Library selects, acquires, arranges, describes, preserves, and makes accessible materials relating to the history of the Alamo, San Antonio, and Texas with particular emphasis on the Republic of Texas period (1836-1846).\nThe Manuscript Collection contains approximately 300 collections of personal and family papers and organizational records as well as approximately 1000 individual documents dating from 1519 to the present. Some of the outstanding archival collections in the library�۪s holdings are the papers of the Bustillo, Cassiano-Perez, Cumings, Maverick families, whose members were early and influential residents of San Antonio and Texas; James T. DeShields�۪s research materials and writings on Texas history; the personal and professional papers of San Antonio architect Leo M. J. Dielmann, including many architectural drawings and plans; art, manuscript material, and artifacts of noted artist Theodore Gentilz and the Fret̩lli̬re family; materials relating to San Antonians John Herndon James, Santiago Rabia, and John W. Smith; and Ernst Schuchard�۪s research materials, photographs, and art about San Antonio history, particularly missions, mills, and irrigation systems. The DRT Library is also the official repository for records of the Battle of Flowers Association and the Yanaguana Society. Researchers can also access microfilm copies of materials in the Thomas W. Streeter Texana collection held by Yale University�۪s Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library.\nThe Photograph Collection contains nearly 40,000 photographic images located in various archival collections and in the library�۪s picture file.

The Library�۪s street address is 1201 River Road, Washington Crossing, PA.\n\n Collection Summary\nThe David Library is primarily a microfilm archive of approximately 10,000 reels that is supported by a reference collection of 40,000 books and pamphlets. Although the main focus is on the American Revolution, in recent years the library has been augmenting its materials on the French and Indian War and the early national periods. Microfilm holdings currently include over 200 collections from domestic and foreign repositories, which are listed in a guide that is distributed free. The library is particularly strong in collections from British sources, some of which are not available elsewhere in this country. It has underwritten the microfilming of significant collections that are relatively inaccessible. The American, British, French, German, and Loyalist perspectives on the American Revolution are well represented in official and personal papers of major and minor figures, in the complete Loyalist claims series, and in military service records such as revolutionary veterans�۪ pension applications and muster rolls of American, British, and Loyalist regiments.\nIn keeping with its expanded chronological emphasis, the library is also acquiring collections that relate to the Confederation and Federalist periods, such as Records of the States of the United States (executive, legislative, and constitutions) and papers of major political figures. Also available are records of the Moravian church and the Anglican Society for the Propagation of the Gospel and the General James Grant Papers. The library is implementing its goal of acquiring every American newspaper available on microfilm that relates to its period of specialization, which are listed in a separate guide. Many doctoral dissertations from American and British universities are also on file, which are also listed in a separate guide. In addition, the library has the Early American Imprints of Charles Evans�۪s American Bibliography, as well as American periodicals, 1741���1800. The library�۪s own Sol Feinstone manuscript collection of approximately 2,500 items, which are significant in content, contains information pertinent to many research projects. A comprehensive indexed guide to the latter is available.\n\n\n Usage Discussion\nSuggestions for approaching the material:\nHousing and getting by for less in the area:\n\n\n\n"

The materials represent the history of the Catholic left during the 1960s through the 1990s.  Philip Berrigan, a former Josephite priest, and Daniel Berrigan, a Jesuit priest and poet, staged significant protests against the Vietnam War during the 1960s and 70s. Philip and his wife Elizabeth McAlister continued the spirit of that civil disobedience through their involvement in the Plowshares movement's opposition to nuclear weapons and through the community they created at Jonah House in Baltimore, Maryland.  Finding Aid: [1]\n\n  Jerome C. Berrigan Collection \nThe papers, correspondence, photographs and memorabilia contained in the Jerome C. Berrigan Collection reflect the nonviolent resistance efforts of the Berrigan family.  While Jerome was only directly involved in a handful of protest movements, he has documented these and many of the other protests in which his brothers Philip and Daniel have taken part.  The collection contains many family photographs and memorabilia, beginning in the late 1800s with Jerome's parents and continuing through the present, with a large group of photographs from Daniel's underground period.  The collection contains extensive files of correspondence to and from Daniel, Philip, and Jerome Berrigan, Jerome's wife Carol and Philip's wife Elizabeth McAlister.  Also contained is a substantial amount of original writing, including poetry, essays, speeches, pamphlets and manuscripts of Daniel's poetry and Philip's prison writings. The collection also reflects relationships the family has made with other peace activists, scholars, authors and entertainers.  Finding Aid:[2]\n\n  Brockman-Romero Collection \nThis collection about Oscar Romero and martyrdom in El Salvador was generated by Rev. James R. Brockman, S.J. Brockman's interest in El Salvador and Romero can be traced back to his position as associate editor of America magazine in New York from 1974 to 1980.The research materials and publications cover the life and murder of Oscar Romero and the persecution of the church in El Salvador between 1977-1993. The papers also contain research materials and publications which were used by Brockman as background for his three books: The Word Remains: A life of Oscar Romero (1982); and Romero: A life (1989), a revised and expanded edition of The Word Remains.  Finding Aid:[3]\n\n  China/Taiwan Mission Collections \nThe following are part of theDeAndreis-Rosati Memorial Archives, Records of the Midwest Province of the Congregation of the Mission (Vincentians) http://library.depaul.edu/Collections/DRMA.aspx\nThe China Mission Photograph Collection documents the missionary presence of the Midwest Province of the Congregation of the Mission in the province of Kiangsi, China in the first half of the twentieth century. The collection dates from 1923 to c.1951.  Finding Aid: [4]The Records of the Procure des Lazaristes contain financial records and correspondence that documents missionary activities of the Vincentian priests and Daughters of Charity after their expulsion from China in 1952 and reveal their efforts to maintain a presence in Asia, specifically Taiwan, Vietnam, Indonesia, and the Philippines during the 1960s-1980s.  Finding Aid:[5]The Vincentian Foreign Mission Society (V.F.M.S.) was established in the late 1930s to raise funds for the Vincentian priests serving in the China missions.  The creation of the V.F.M.S. can be seen as a means to supply the confreres monetarily, but it also served as a means to encourage and strengthen the will of the missionaries as they were separated from their families and friends.  Finding Aid:[6]\n\n Collection Summary\nThe Special Collections and Archives Department is the repository for DePaul University Library�۪s rare books and unique documents.  Research strengths include the history of urban renewal in Lincoln Park; women�۪s community organizations against domestic violence; Catholic social justice; Victorian illustrated books; Napoleon; St. Vincent de Paul; and the Congregation of the Mission (Vincentians).  The department also maintains the archives of DePaul University, which include faculty members published books and student theses and dissertations.  All collections reflect DePaul�۪s commitment to the academic quality of its curricular programs, the research needs of its faculty, involvement with community organizations, and its Vincentian and Catholic identity.  These collections are available for use in classroom instruction sessions; for research use by faculty and students; and open to the public.\n\n Usage Discussion\nSuggestions for approaching the material:\nHousing and getting by for less in the area: \n\n\n  Fellowships and Funding Opportunities \n  Major Topic Areas \n\n\n"

The state of Bavaria (of which Munich is the capital) is pre-dominantly catholic, so apart from the usual holidays like Christmas and Easter, there are also a number of other public holidays in this state, which are not present in other areas of Germany.\n\n Working language(s)\nGerman, most staff speaks English.\n\n Layout\nThe reading room is comparably small and also hosts the desks of some of the staff. At the one end there are shelves with most of the archive's photo holdings, which can be picked from the shelf directly. All other materials are brought to your desk by the archivist.\n\n Directions\nMunich is the capital of Bavaria, in the very south of Germany. It is rather close to the Austrian border and on the fringes of the Alps.\nThe Deutsches Museum is well-known in Munich, so just anybody local can tell you how to get there. The Museum building is located on an island in the Isar river and can be reached by bus, tram or suburban train (see below). The entrance to the library building is opposite to the museum's entrance. When entering the building, you'll face the reception. Just tell the porter you want to go the archive, and he'll let you through. The archive is located on third floor and may be a bit difficult to find. There are signs, however, guiding you, and you may ask the porter for directions.\nAccomodation is not hard to find, as Munich is a major city and a hotspot of tourism. Munich, however, is one of the more expensive places in Germany. There are a number of budget accomodations, though. Rooms may be hard to find during fairs and the famous Oktoberfest (end of September).\nThe Deutsches Museum also offers guest rooms for researchers. Inquiries can be made with Mrs. Andrea Walther: a.walther@deutsches-museum.de\n\n Holdings\n Description of holdings\nFrom the archive's webpage: \"The Deutsches Museum Archive is one of Europe�۪s most important archives specializing in the history of science and technology.  Altogether it has some 4500 m of shelves holding source documents and other archive material on this subject.  Particular points of emphasis are transport and aerospace, computing, and the history of physics and chemistry.\"\nEspecially the material on aerospace history is very rich, as the archive holds the documents from companies like Messerschmitt, Junkers, Heinkel, etc. These include correspondence, internal memos, technical drawings, etc. Furthermore, there are also collections from German aviation journalists in the archive.\nThe archive also has a large photograph, film and sound recording collection.\nIn the archive you'll find collection on persons from engineering, science, and inventors; a huge number of historical manuals, brochures, price lists etc. from companies; technical drawings; maps; portraits from and medals given to scientists and engineers; and much more.\nLiterature detailing the archive's holdings:\n\n Wilhelm F�_��l / Eva A. Mayring: The Archives and Special Collections of the Deutsches Museum in Munich. In: Science & Technology Libraries 14, 1994, 7-16.\n\nA visit to the museum's library might also be worthwile, as it holds a large number of historic technical and scientific journals (both German and foreign), including company circulars, and a number of historic books.\n\n History of the archive\nThe archive has taken over several large collections from company archives from companies like Messerschmitt or Siemens. It has not given away any collections, to my knowledge. The archive started to collect material when the museum was founded in 1903.\n\n Catalogues & finding aids\nThere are printed finding aids in the reading room. Some collections can be browsed online through above's web page. There is also a database,but this is for internal uses only. All inquiries have to be made to a member of staff, who can look up the search terms in the database for you. It is highly advisable to get in touch with the archivists ASAP to make out what material might be of interest to your research.\n\n Languages of materials\nChiefly German, but the archive also holds material in other languages.\n\n Restrictions & difficulties\nThere are no general restrictions on using material. Restrictions may apply for certain personal documents. Check with the archivists.\n\n Classified material\nThe archive does not hold any classified material, to my knowledge.\n\n Inaccessible material\nSome material might be inaccessible because of embargo periods. According to German law, documents are generally accessible 30 years after their creation date. Personal documents (non-official documents authored by individuals) are accessible 30 years after the person's death (110 years after the person's birth if the death date is unknown). This applies to a number of the collections in this archive.\n\n Future of the archive\nThe Deutsches Museum has a long tradition and is supported by the policial administration and industrialists in Germany. As it is very prestigous for those groups, the Museum (and with it its archive) is likely to remain where it is for quite some time ahead. The museum space is coming to its limits, and there have already museum branches been founded elsewhere in town to allow for more exhibitions. Refurbishment of the buildings are undergoing, and floodings from the river Isar were also an issue in the past. This has not affected the archive, yet.\n\n Research procedures\n Access\nThe archive is open to the general public. You must mail (e-mail or postal) to the archive in advance to apply for access, detailing the research you intend to do. Once at the archive, you have to fill out a form to register as user. No reader's ticket will be issued, as the form is stored and needs to be renewed every year (i.e. if you visit the archive again the same year, you don't need to fill out another form. If you go there next year, you do). Usually, no form of identification needs to be produced, but that policy might change.\n\n First visit\nYou fill out a form (see above) to register as user. Then, one of the archivists will interview you about your research, both to help you and to control the use of the documents.\n\n Permitted and prohibited items\n(if possible, account for laptop computers, cameras, scanners, phones, pens and pencils, loose papers, and so on)\n\nPermitted: Laptop computers, notepads, pens, pencils.\nProhibited: Cameras, scanners, phones.\n\n Document ordering\nDocuments are ordered on paper slips.\n\n Ordering classified material\nThis requires a written application to the archive. Since you need to apply by mail to access the archive, anyway, this can be done in the same letter.\n\n Document delivery\nThe storage room is adjacent to the reading room, delivery time is therefore usually short, depending on the workload of the archivist. Documents are delivered into the reading room to your workplace. You must sign that you've been given the documents on a list presented to you by the archivist. There is no specific limit on the number of documents that can be held at one time, but the archvist may ask for a sensible number of documents to be ordered. Once finished, you can leave the documents at your working place. The archivist will collect them. In case you order new documents, the archivist will pick up those documents when he or she delivers the new round.\n\n Photocopying, photography, microfilming\nNo photographing is allowed in the reading room. There is a photocopier in the reading room where you can copy most documents yourself, unless the material is marked as sensitive. Photocopies are 10ct per A4 page, you pay the total of your copies when you leave the reading room.\nFor sensitive material or reproductions of photographs, the archive offers a reproduction service. This can usually be done within a couple of days, or send to your home address. Prices vary depending on the type of reproduction. Ask the archive for details.\n\n Key forms\nThe only form is the register form, which is not online.\n\n Key individuals\n Archive staff\nThe archive's head is Dr. Wilheml F�_ssl and his proxy is Dr. Eva Mayring. There are also a number of assistants around. All of the staff is friendly and helpful.\n\n Scholars\nThe researchers and curators of the Deutsches Museum are well familiar with the archive's holdings. See http://www.deutsches-museum.de/en/research/wissenschaftl-mitarbeiter/ for a list of staff members.\n\n Bibliography\nToo many to list here. The archive holdings are very broad and voluminous, and so are the publications resulting from research in it.\n\n Practicalities\n Food\nThere are vending machines in the entrance hall of the building, and the museum has a restaurant which is adjacent to the library building. There are also a good number of restaurants and shops in the vicinity. There is no food allowed in the archive, but there are chairs and tables near the vending machines where food can be consumed.\n\n Lockers\nLockers can be found near the library's entrance, which is in the same building.\n\n Washrooms\nThere are restrooms on the same floor as the reading room, down the aisle.\n\n Transportation\nMunich has an international airport and a major railway station. Within the city an excellent public transport system is available. The Deutsches Museum is served by the suburban trains (German: S-Bahn), station: \"Isartor\". From there it is just a five minute walk. The museum is also served by tram line 17 (station again \"Isartor\") or line 18 (station: \"Deutsches Museum\"); by underground lines U1 and U2, (station: Fraunhofer Strasse); and by the bus line 131 (stop: \"Boschbr�_cke\").\n\n Internet access\nNone.\n\n Funding\nThe research institution of the Deutsches Museum offers a funding program called \"Scholar in Residence\", for either six or twelve month. See http://www.deutsches-museum.de/en/research/scholar-in-residence/ for details. You'll not only get a decent lump of money, you'll also get some privileges (like free photocopies in the archive or free entrance to the museum), as you are receiving member-of-staff status during the scholarship period.\n\n Bookstore\nThe archive itself has no books for sale. However, attached to the museum is a museum shop which among other things sells publications of the Deutsches Museum.\n\n See also\n(links to relevant websites and resources)\n\n\n\n"

The response you receive will come from a specific person.\n\n Hours and usage restrictions\nAs of August 2008, the library is open 8:30 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. and 12:45 p.m. to 5:15 p.m. Monday through Friday. They do not offer weekend hours, and researchers MUST leave during the lunch hour.\nMany of the holdings were donated and may have usage restrictions; check specific finding aids for details.\n\n Collection Summary\nThe Dwight D. Eisenhower Presidential Library and Museum is part of the presidential libraries system administered by the National Archives and Records Administration.\n\n\n Usage Discussion\nSuggestions for approaching the material:\nEmail the facility first, and review their website in detail. In addition to the alphabetical finding aids, the subject guides are incredibly useful.  When you get there, make sure to talk to the archivists first -- their knowledge of the material is phenomenal!\nHousing and getting by for less in the area:\nAbilene's Victorian Inn [1] has a policy of turning away gay couples.  The policy is stated euphemistically on their website (\"Overnight accommodations for singles and traditional couples.\" [2]).  In June 2010, it prompted a complaint on TripAdvisor [3].  The innkeepers explained to me (Amy Offner, Columbia University) that this was their policy when I visited Abilene in June-July 2010.\nAnother B&B on the Abilene Convention and Visitor's Bureau website also references a special researcher rate.  The cheapest option seems to be the Diamond Motel ($40 with AAA; www.diamondmotel.com), located in a residential area of town (nice and quiet).  Each room has a fridge and some have microwaves (there's not much to eat in Abilene in the evenings besides fast food, but the grocery store is open til 10, 7 days a week).  Surprisingly, the best coffee in town was the dark roast at the gas station across from the motel.\nLike most towns in the Midwest, everyone drives and few people take public transportation (even where it exists).  Abilene is no different.  \nEisenhower Foundation has a ���Host Committee�۝ that offers free support services:\n-pick up/return to Junction City when using Road Runner Express from MCI\n-foundation bicycle use for local transport\n-dinner with Host Committee members at a local restaurant\n-assistance making physician appts in Abilene\nEisenhower Foundation: PO Box 295, 200 SE 4th Street, Abilene, 67410 (785.263.6700 ��� eisenhowerfoundation@nara.gov)\nAlso note: you have to do an application (available online) and get a card when you arrive.\nThere are lockers outside the research room, and they are free to use. You will check in with the receptionist on the first floor when you arrive.\n\n\n\n"

Lee Library at Brigham Young University, where it was begun in 1995 by Richard Hacken, European Studies Bibliographer. \nMost of the links are to external sources, but within the scope and linkage of EuroDocs are a number of digital treasures connected to the sponsoring institution, BYU.  \nJesse Hurlbut of the French and Italian Department has assembled DScriptorium (���D�۝ stands for ���digital�۝), an online image collection of medieval manuscripts.  \nThe page for Spain features facsimiles and transcriptions of previously unpublished, late fifteenth-century letters of King Philip II held in the L. Tom Perry Special Collections Library.  \nIn cooperation with Centro Interuniversitario di Ricerche sul Viaggio in Italia, CIRVI, an international research center housed in Turin, Italy, and initially as part of a sister-city relationship between the 2002 and 2006 Winter Olympic venues, digitization of Accounts of American Travelers to Italy is ongoing ��� from Henry Adams to Washington Irving, from Harriet Beecher Stowe to Mark Twain.  \nMonaco�۪s history ��� from a barren rock fortress protecting the marine interests of the Holy Roman Empire to a principality sheltering high rollers and billionaires ��� is being documented online with BYU efforts in league with European archives.  \nA number of EuroDocs pages point to the World War I Document Archive, a high-traffic attraction on the BYU Library server, among whose sources are found hundreds of transcribed Austro-Hungarian documents on the 1914 outbreak of war.  The library was also fortunate to get ownership of complete copies of the original Eisenhower Communiqu̩s, a collection of dispatches documenting the Allied advance across Europe after D-Day in 1944, so that these typescripts and their searchable transcriptions could become a part of the HBLL�۪s digital collections.\n\n Usage Discussion\nSuggestions for approaching the material: by Internet connection.\n\nContributions to EuroDocs:  Since EuroDocs is a wiki, historians, archivists, and other interested parties are welcome to contribute their own links to online primary documents for Europe or a given country in Europe.  Contact the wikimaster for a password. \n\n  Major Topic Areas \nThe main page of EuroDocs points to 46 separate web indexes for countries and city-states of Europe,as well as to sites for \"Medieval and Renaissance Europe\" and for \"Europe as a Supranational Region\".  \n\nCountries include:\n\n\n\n\n\nAlbania\nAndorra\nAustria\nBelarus\nBelgium\nBosnia\nBulgaria\nCroatia\nCyprus\nCzech Republic\nDenmark\nEngland: See UK\n\n\n\nEstonia\nFinland\nFrance\nGermany\nGreece\nHungary\nIceland\nIreland\nItaly\nLatvia\nLiechtenstein\nLithuania\n\n\n\nLuxembourg\nMacedonia\nMalta\nMoldova\nMonaco\nMontenegro\nNetherlands\nNorway\nPoland\nPortugal\nRomania\nRussia\n\n\n\nSan Marino\nScotland: See UK\nSerbia\nSlovakia\nSlovenia\nSpain\nSweden\nSwitzerland\nTurkey\nUkraine\nUnited Kingdom\nVatican City\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Many rare items are contained in the book and pamphlet collection, which consists of local and regional histories, biographies, works of Kentucky authors, Civil War history, city directories, travel accounts, and family histories. There is an extensive collection of early maps of Kentucky and the southeastern United States along with late 19th-century county atlases. The library has one of the largest collections of 19th-century Kentucky newspapers in original issue. The microfilm collection contains all U.S. census records for Kentucky and some for Virginia and other states, tax lists for all Kentucky counties through 1850, all of the available 19th-century Kentucky vital records, the Draper manuscript collection, the Shane papers, and some newspapers. Some turn-of-the-century funeral home and cemetery records for Jefferson County, Kentucky, are available, and the family files, with over 3,000 surnames, provide a unique resource for family historians. Over 4,000 pieces of 19th-century sheet music are available, particularly from the antebellum and Civil War eras.\nThe manuscript collection contains approximately 1.5 million items. It consists of papers generated by individuals and families and of archival records created by businesses, institutions, and organizations. The papers consist primarily of letters, diaries, legal documents, and ephemera as well as the archives of business, religious, educational, governmental, civic, and fraternal organizations and other records. The collection dates from the 17th century to the present, and it is the strongest in the state for Kentucky�۪s pioneer, antebellum, and Civil War periods. The collection focuses on Kentucky and the Ohio Valley but is also national and international in scope, including materials relating to the Lewis and Clark Expedition.\nThe photograph and print collection contains approximately 40,000 images and several hundred lithographs, engravings, and other prints. The R. C. Ballard Thruston Photograph Collection comprises 10,500 negatives and prints picturing life, people, and scenes in Kentucky, other states, and foreign countries from the 1880s through the 1930s. Other photographs document architecture, river history, agriculture, commerce, industry, and many aspects of social history.\nThe Filson�۪s museum collections are available to students of material culture. The museum�۪s more important study collections are portraits (nearly 400 portraits from the early 19th to the mid-20th century are included in the collection), late 19th- and early 20th-century clothing, coin silver, quilts, and coverlets.\nThe collection can be searched through an integrated online catalog available at http://filson.ipac.dynixasp.com/ or through a link on the Filson�۪s web site. A portion of the material is available in digital format in the online collection of The First American West, hosted by the Library of Congress at http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/award99/icuhtml/fawhome.html. \n\n\n Usage Discussion\nSuggestions for approaching the material:\nHousing and getting by for less in the area:\n\n\n\n"

The major collections are those of the American Forestry Association, a citizen�۪s conservation group founded in 1875; the American Forest Council, the forest industry�۪s educational arm, founded in 1941; the National Forest Products Association, now called American Forest and Paper Association, the forest industry�۪s primary trade association, founded in 1902; and the Society of American Foresters, a professional group founded in 1900. In addition, the society maintains a computerized archival guide listing more than 7,000 groups of records in 450 repositories across North America.\nThe Forest History Society�۪s library has approximately 9,000 books, 240 journal titles, 1,200 maps, and 600 manuscripts dealing with all aspects of forest and conservation history. It also houses the U.S. Forest Service Headquarters History Collection. The library maintains a photograph collection of some 25,000 images that is particularly rich in photos of early lumbering techniques and equipment. A small portion of the photograph collection is searchable on the society�۪s web site. \n\n\n Usage Discussion\nSuggestions for approaching the material:\nHousing and getting by for less in the area:\n\n\n\n"

Most of the Frances Willard correspondence and scrapbooks, as well as Woman's Christian Temperance Unon (WCTU) Annual Meeting Minutes to 1934 and the Union Signal (national newspaper) to 1933, were microfilmed in 1977 as part of the Prohibition and Temperance Papers project (Ohio Historical Society, Michigan Historical Society, and WCTU). A Guide to the Microfilm was published in 1977. A number of research libraries own some or all of the microfilm. Check WorldCat for availability through Inter-Library Loan. No other finding aids exist.\n\n Collection Summary\nThe Frances Willard Memorial Library was founded as a resource for officers and staff of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) working on educational and publication projects to promote the organization�۪s mission. The collection originally consisted of books, reports, and serials from outside sources, as well as copies of everything published by the WCTU. The archival materials were a small part of the collection. Over the years, the focus shifted as researchers began to use the collection to study Willard and the WCTU. The Frances Willard Historical Association (FWHA) assumed management of the Willard Library and Archives in January, 2007. Recognizing the collection's value to historians of women�۪s movements, temperance, social reform, and other fields, the FWHA�۪s Library and Archives Committee hopes to develop this rich collection into a more accessible resource for researchers. \nHoldings include: \n�ۢ\tThe Frances Willard Papers: approximately ten cubic feet of correspondence (mostly incoming), 80 scrapbooks, 50 journal volumes\n�ۢ\tPersonal papers of other WCTU Presidents (small collections)\n�ۢ\tRecords of National and World�۪s WCTU, and of local and state Unions \n�ۢ\tSubject files on events, traditions, people, and places associated with the WCTU\n�ۢ\tPamphlets, flyers, informational and educational material, sheet music, and songbooks produced by the WCTU\n�ۢ\tPhotographs of individuals, groups, and events in WCTU history\n�ۢ\tArtifacts, including banners and promotional material\n�ۢ\tSerial publications published by the National WCTU, the World�۪s WCTU, and by state and local Unions (including meeting minutes and programs, newsletters, and handbooks)\n�ۢ\tApproximately 3000 volumes on temperance and alcoholism, the WCTU and other temperance groups, woman suffrage and other social issues, dating from the 1840s-present, with the bulk dating from 1880s-1940s. \n�ۢ\tDissertations and theses based on Willard Library and Archives resources\n�ۢ\tPublications and pamphlets produced by other temperance organizations (1840s-20th century)\n\n Usage Discussion\nSuggestions for approaching the material:\nThe Willard Memorial Library and Archives is currently not staffed, and relies on FWHA Committee members, aided by occasional interns and volunteer research assistants, to assist onsite researchers and respond to reference inquiries. Thus patience is advised--we respond to inquiries and set up research appointments to the best of our ability.\n\n\n\n  Major Topic Areas \nWomen's history, social reform, women's organizations, rhetoric, temperance and prohibition\n\n\n\n"

The archives does not collect the records of affiliated unions at either the national or local level and, therefore, does not document the work of those bodies or the activities of rank-and-file members.\n\n Usage Discussion\nSuggestions for approaching the material:\nHousing and getting by for less in the area: \n\n\n  Fellowships and Funding Opportunities \n  Major Topic Areas \nLabor law, child labor, women in the labor movement, labor and religion, organizing\n\n\n\n"

      "Archive_Info": "The Georgia Archives is the official repository of archival records for the State of Georgia. Together with the Georgia Capitol Museum it forms the Georgia Division of Archives and History, part of the Office of the Secretary of State of Georgia. The primary purpose of the Georgia Archives is to identify which state agency records are worth preserving for hundreds of years, transfer those records to the archives, protect them, and make them available to people who need them. In addition, the archives helps state agencies and local governments manage active records and stores the inactive records of state government in the State Records Center. \n\nContents\n\n1 Orientation\n2 Holdings\n3 Research procedures\n4 Practicalities\n5 See also\n\n\n Orientation\nAddress - Georgia Archives, 5800 Jonesboro Road, Morrow, Georgia, 30260-1101\nWebsite - http://www.GeorgiaArchives.org\nTelephone - (678) 364-3700\nFax - (678) 364-3860\nEmail - Various.

For directions, maps, public transportation, and road construction information, visit http://www.GeorgiaArchives.org. \n\n Holdings\nOriginal Records - The Georgia Archives primarily houses official state government records and a significant collection of local government records. Most of these are unpublished, original source materials maintained in their original format or on microfilm, all stored in a climate-controlled environment. Archival holdings also include non-governmental documents of cultural and historical value. Included in these manuscript collections are family letters and papers, business records and account books and materials such as minutes and reports of social, professional, and other organizations. Georgia Archives is actively entering descriptions of these records into Online Descriptive Inventories. The Georgia Archives produces a Descriptive Inventory (formerly known as \"PDIs\") for each government record series in its collection. Each Descriptive Inventory includes information about the agency that created the series, the date span of the records, what information is found in the records, a list of folder titles in the series (in most cases), and related information. \nMicrofilm/Microfiche\nGeorgia Archives' microfilm library contains nearly 30,000 reels available for public use. This includes Georgia governmental records, selected U.S. records, Georgia county records, tax digests, private papers, church records, cemetery records, newspapers, genealogical records, Bible records, books and periodicals, selected out-of-state and foreign records, and a few municipal records. Some of the material that is most frequently referenced includes the Federal census schedules; Georgia Confederate Service and Pension Records; Colonial and Headright and Bounty land grants; Land Lottery and Georgia county records. \nMaps\nGeorgia's official land and cartographic records are a significant part of the Georgia Archives' holdings. By law, county boundary changes and municipal annexations, are filed with the Secretary of State's Office in the Archives. In addition, holdings include the State's original Surveyor General collection, which includes over 10,000 county and state maps. Also available for research are microfilm copies of 1.5 million land grants and plats from 1755 to 1909. \nBooks and Periodicals\nGeorgia Archives' collection of secondary sources supplements the holdings of original records. All published materials are cataloged in our on-line catalog.  They include (but are not limited to) Georgia county histories and record abstracts, compiled bibliographies, various indexes, genealogy guidebooks, guides to the collection of other institutions, and patriotic lineage society publications such as the Georgia State Society, Daughters of the American Revolution Collection. Additionally, there are sources on the Atlantic coastal states and the southeastern United States that include general state histories, county histories, abstracts of county records, and newspaper indexes and abstracts. There are also compiled histories of Georgia families, often including information on branches in other states, as well as current loose issues and bound volumes of periodicals relating to history and genealogy.

It houses an important collection of manuscripts, photographs, books, and artifacts documenting the history of America�۪s business and technology. Hagley�۪s main strength is in the Middle Atlantic region and the Brandywine Valley, but in recent years the scope of collecting has broadened to include records of and works about business organizations and companies with national impact. \nThe imprints collection consists of approximately 225,000 volumes and 12,500 microforms. Included are books, serials, pamphlets, maps and atlases, city directories, trade catalogs, theses, and government documents. Business history and biography comprise more than one-third of the imprints collections. Included are works on economics and economic history, labor, transportation and communication, commerce, consumerism, industrial design, commercial architecture, advertising, finance, and corporate history. Company annual reports, stockholder and employee magazines, advertising literature, and public relations pieces complement archival collections.\nHagley possesses a distinguished collection for the study of the history of technology. The 25,000 trade catalogs, most of which were published between 1880 and 1920, are important resources for the study of America�۪s commercial, technological, and industrial development. The catalogs are also useful for historic restorations, artifact identification, and race and gender studies. The trade catalog collection has been described in a separate collections guide.\nHagley�۪s collection of guidebooks and catalogs for the great international expositions trace international technology transfer and the introduction of manufactured goods to the public. The American fairs at Philadelphia (1876), Chicago (1893), and St. Louis (1904) are well represented in Hagley�۪s collection, as is the London Crystal Palace Exhibition of 1851.\nThe European roots of American business and technological development are documented in the rare book and pamphlet collections, which include works on 18th-century French history and economic theory, with a particular emphasis on physiocracy.\nThe Guttman Collection of pyrotechnics consists of some 800 books and many pamphlets on explosives and military subjects; it is particularly strong in books about fireworks published between 1500 and 1900.\nHagley�۪s 29,000 linear feet of manuscripts collections contain the records of more than 1,000 firms as well as the personal papers of the entrepreneurs who helped build them. The library is also the repository for the records of national business organizations, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers, and the American Iron and Steel Institute. \nThe companies represented range from the mercantile houses of the late 18th century, through the artisan workshops of the 19th, to the multinational corporations of the 20th century. The collections illustrate the impact of the business system on American society���its economic, technological, political, and labor history.\nThe business and personal papers of the DuPont Company and family were the core collections around which the library developed. The papers of Pierre Samuel du Pont de Nemours (1739���1817) are an important resource for students of 18th-century French history. Those of his son, E. I. du Pont and other family members document the 1802 founding and subsequent operation of the DuPont Company�۪s powder mills. Twentieth-century records describe the transformation of the company into a modern corporation. \nThe history of the northeastern railways is well represented in Hagley�۪s collections, which include the records of the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad and significant parts of the Pennsylvania Railroad archives. Records and photographs documenting the history of energy development and use can be found in the archives of the Sun Company, the Westmoreland Coal Company, the Penn Virginia Corporation, and St. Clair Coal Company. The archives of the Pennsylvania Power and Light Company trace the development of the electric industry in eastern Pennsylvania. Similarly, the history of the iron and steel industry can be traced through the records of Bethlehem Steel Corporation, Lukens Steel Company, Alan Wood Steel Company, and Phoenix Steel Corporation.\nMany collections chronicle the progress of high technology in the 20th century. The Elmer Sperry papers and the papers and photographs of the Sperry Gyroscope Company (1909���65) document the history of pioneering scientific and technical firms that became important military contractors. Records and photographs of Sperry-UNIVAC, the Eckert-Mauchly Company, Engineering Research Associates, and the IBM antitrust suit trace the early history of the computer and aeronautics industries. Hagley also has major collections on the history of atomic energy from the Manhattan Project onward. Records of the MCI Communications Corporation detail many aspects of the computer and communications revolution, the development of electronic mail, and the evolution of national telecommunications policies.\nIn recent years, Hagley has begun to document the history of America�۪s consumer culture. The records of Joseph E. Seagram & Sons Company and Avon Products provide invaluable information on mass marketing, advertising, and market research. Product and package design are well represented in the papers of industrial designers Raymond Loewy, Thomas Lamb, and Marc Harrison. \nThe Pictorial Collections and Audiovisual Services Department provide visual and aural documentation within the scope of Hagley�۪s research areas. Many of the collections, which vary in size from one image to more than 100,000, are directly related to holdings in the Manuscripts and Archives Department. The collections consist primarily of 20th-century black-and-white still photography. Other formats found throughout the holdings range from daguerreotypes to Polaroid prints, lithographs and engravings, motion pictures, videotapes, and sound recordings. Hagley�۪s pictorial archives are organized by individual collections; finding aids to specific collections contain entries for the major subjects covered.\nThe artifact collections of the Hagley Museum number approximately 250,000 objects. They range from historic architecture and landscape to decorative and fine arts to scientific instruments, hand tools, and industrial machinery. Noteworthy is the decorative arts collection assembled by Louise duPont Crowninshield, which is particularly strong in hooked rugs, English ceramics, and American and English textiles. Hagley has an important collection of patent models, small-scale versions of inventions submitted along with patent applications to the Commissioner of Patents.\nDuring the past 30 years, Hagley�۪s collections have formed the basis of many classic studies in economic, business, and technological history. More recently, younger scholars working on broad interdisciplinary projects that transcend the boundaries between business, technological, labor, social, and cultural history, have begun to make use of the library. These scholars have sought to understand the ways in which advertising documents, social and cultural attitudes, the process of ���getting work,�۝ the dynamics of class formation, and how labor market segmentation has affected women and racial and ethnic minorities.\n\n\n Usage Discussion\nSuggestions for approaching the material:\nHousing and getting by for less in the area:\n\n\n\n"

The Hargrett promotes the state�۪s literary legacy; and it builds collections of distinction in other areas, including natural history, history of the book, performing arts, women�۪s history, and University history.\nThe manuscripts area of the Hargrett Rare Book and Manuscript Library is the repository for over six million individual items including family papers, diaries, letters, theatrical papers, corporate and organizational papers. Included in this count are over five hundred thousand images, made up of drawings, paintings, photographs, daguerreotypes, tintypes, cased images, slides and negatives. The manuscripts area collects primarily materials relating to Georgia and Georgians, though the international performing arts collections form a second major strength. Chronologically, the collections are strongest in 19th Century materials.\nThe Hargrett Library Rare Book unit contains approximately 120,000 rare books on a variety of subjects. Special emphasis is placed on rare books, maps, broadsides and other printed material dealing with the State of Georgia and the Southeast as the state developed from pre-Colonial times to the present. The Hargrett Library also specializes in the History of the Book including an extensive collection of over 10,000 books relating to the small press and fine printing particularly in the United States. Confederate Imprints, books and other printed material printed in the Confederate States during the War of the Rebellion exclusive of occupation, are another subject area traditionally collected by the Hargrett Library. In addition, the Hargrett Library collects books on the performing arts especially books relevant to costume design.\nThe University of Georgia Archives Unit preserves over two centuries of the University's history in the form of official records, images, plans, publications and artifacts.\n\n Contact Information\n Address\nHargrett Rare Book and Manuscript Library\nRussell Special Collections Libraries Building\n300 S.

The receptionist, who signs in researchers and issues keys for the lockers/wardrobe, is to the left.  The lockers are to the right, before the entrance to the reading room.  The archivist on call sits in a room to the right as you walk into the reading room, and the desk for ordering, receiving, and returning materials is in the far back left.  Each seat has its own electrical outlets and lamp.\n\n Directions to the archive\nFrom the main train station, take the U-Bahn lines 3, 7, or 9 in the direction of Wettbergen/Empelde to the stop Waterlooplatz (just a few minutes). The station is across the street from the archive.\nSee here for a map from the archive.\n\n Holdings\n Research procedures\n Access\nAs a state archive, the Hauptstaatsarchiv Hannover is open to all, though registration is required.  You can register the day of your visit by filling out a form from the receptionist and discussing your application with the archivist on duty, though contacting the archive in advance will speed the ordering of your materials.\n\n Permitted and prohibited items\nPermitted: Laptop computers, pens, pencils, paper, notebooks.\nProhibited: Cameras, phones.\n\n Document ordering and delivery\nIn the reading room, documents are ordered on slips available on the desks and submitted in at the desk for ordering and retrieving materials. You can order three items per slip, and have up to 15 total documents out at any one time. Items are placed with the researcher's name visible on the slips on shelves by the desk. There are also separate shelves for returning finished documents and for reserving materials with which you plan to continue. Items are retrieved at 4 intervals throughout the day (see above for times.)\nSome items are currently stored offsite in Pattensen, and the call numbers are a little unpredictable. It seems even the offsite materials can still be retrieved in a few hours.\n\n Photocopying, photography, microfilming\nTaking photographs is not allowed, but photocopying and digital reproduction is offered. There are no page limits per item. The order form is available from the archivist, and there are strips on each reading table that allow you to mark the pages in each file which you want copied. Mark the strip with a V (vor-) for the front side of a page, an R (r�_ck-) for the back side of a page, or arrows to indicate a series of pages to be copied. Return the file to the archivist. Costs are quite varied depending on the kind of document and the form of reproduction. A detailed list of options (in German) is available as a PDF on the Nieders�_chsisches Landesarchiv website.\n\n Key individuals\nThe archive staff with whom I've interacted (in particular, Frau Hoffmann) are exceptionally helpful and friendly.\n\n Practicalities\n Lockers\nThe lockers are varied in size and do not require a deposit. There are coat hangers in the entryway.\n\n Food\nI don't believe there is any food available in the building.  A couple of blocks away on Calenberger Str. you can find a vegan Asian place with a ���5.50 lunch menu, a more expensive Italian restaurant, and a couple of convenience stores.\n\n Internet and Computers\nThere is no internet access, unfortunately. International visitors, note that the electronic outlets at each seat may not necessarily fit certain plug adapters.  I found a suitable surge protector under at least one table, however. There are at least two computers available with access to the online catalog.\n\n See also\n\n\n"

Included are papers documenting his career as a mining engineer, his activities as director of relief agencies during and following World War I, his tenure as secretary of commerce (1921���28), his presidency (1929���33), and his postpresidential activities. Along with Hoover�۪s own papers are copies of selected records groups from the National Archives that document the activities of federal agencies associated with Hoover, such as the U.S. Food Administration, or conferences that he convened, such as the White House Conference on Child Health. Also included are the papers of his wife, Lou Henry Hoover.\nIn addition to the Hoover Papers, the library contains 275 other collections of papers from individuals who either worked with Herbert Hoover, or were associated with him through shared areas of interest or activity. Some of the more prominent collections include the papers of Hoover associate and chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission Lewis Strauss, U.S. senators Gerald Nye of North Dakota and Bourke Hickenlooper of Iowa, chairman of Sears, Roebuck & Company Robert E. Wood, conservative newspaper columnists Westbrook Pegler, Walter Trohan, and Clark Mollenhoff, as well as writer and journalist Rose Wilder Lane, whose papers include correspondence with and manuscripts from her mother, Laura Ingalls Wilder. Along with Hoover�۪s life and presidency, other areas of research interest covered by the manuscript collections include atomic energy, aviation, international relief work, agricultural economics, the isolationist movement prior to World War II, and conservative political thought in the mid-20th century.\nAudiovisual holdings include 39,500 still. photographs, 153,000 feet of 16mm movies, 420 hours of audiotape, 19 hours of videotape, and 78 audio discs. Transcripts of 443 oral history interviews are also available for use. A book collection of over 20,000 volumes���most relating to the period of Herbert Hoover�۪s life���is available in the Reading Room, as are periodicals related to Hoover, and microfilmed newspapers, theses, and dissertations.\n\n\n Usage Discussion\nSuggestions for approaching the material:  \nFinding aids are online, but double-check with archivists as some info is not completely up-to-date.\nThe library can be a bit noisy, with people walking through all day, so bring earplugs if you're easily distracted.\nHousing and getting by for less in the area:  \nI was strongly cautioned against staying at the Presidential Inn in West Branch.  The Travelodge in Iowa City has a special rate for researchers ($55 a night, which they lowered to $49 when they found out I was staying for two weeks), which includes \"continental breakfast\" (cereal and bagels).  Rooms have coffee-makers, and you can get a fridge and microwave for an extra charge.  It's a nice 15-minute drive to West Branch (take the Herbert Hoover Highway for better views).  In West Branch, try \"Reid's Beans\" for lunch -- fresh, delicious, homemade food, good coffee, and friendly owners, all for 5-7 bucks.\n\n\n\n"

Project currently underway to enhance electronic access to collections.\n\n Collection Summary\n Museum Collections\nWilliam Sumner Appleton founded SPNEA, now known as Historic New England, in 1910 for \"the purpose of preserving for posterity buildings, places and objects of historical and other interest.\" This mandate has given Historic New England considerable freedom and has resulted in an extraordinarily broad collection of objects of historical and aesthetic significance, family heirlooms presented in their original context, and household ephemera that might not otherwise have been saved.\nHistoric New England's holdings have grown dramatically. The accession records for 1910 list 19 items. Today, the collection contains more than 100,000 objects, and is the largest assemblage of New England art and artifacts in the country.\nMany institutions have chosen to collect masterpieces. However, Appleton also considered the mundane, the ordinary, and the trivial worth preserving. Thus, Historic New England's collection reflects both the necessities and the luxuries of New Englanders -- from a utilitarian cake of soap with its late 18th-century Newburyport, Mass., label to the spectacular Queen Anne style japanned high chest of drawers that descended in the Quincy family.\nIn addition to its diversity, the Historic New England collection is remarkable for its documentation. Ledgers, inventories, photographs and histories of ownership have enabled Historic New England to identify many original owners and makers.\nThe collection is further distinguished by the fact that much of it is displayed in its original context. The Sayward-Wheeler House in York Harbor, Maine, for example, still contains most of Jonathan Sayward's furnishings, in some cases in the very locations he selected.\nJames Rundlet's possessions are still largely in the house he built in Portsmouth, N.H., between 1807 and 1808. At the Codman Estate in Lincoln, Mass., several \"old master\" paintings bought in Paris in the 1790s by Richard Codman and shipped to his brother John in Boston, decorate the walls.\nAll too often, re-created period rooms are based on written or pictorial evidence which cannot convey the distinctive imprint of the original owner. The survival of furnishings in their original context constitutes Historic New England's most valuable asset.\n\n\n Library and Archival Collections\nThe Library and Archives is one of Historic New England's greatest resources. Every year hundreds of researchers come to the Library and Archives to study the more than one million items that document New England's architectural and cultural history. The archival collections include photographs, prints and engravings, architectural drawings, books, manuscripts, and ephemera.\nIn abundance and variety, photographs outrank all other forms of information. The more than 300,000 images are arranged by specific medium, including extensive collections of daguerreotypes, ambrotypes, cartes de visite, stereographic views, albums, postcards, and standard prints. They record buildings, domestic interiors, commercial interiors, streetscapes, landscapes, people at work, people relaxing and at play, and modes of transportation. Many of New England's leading 19th- and early 20th-century photographers are represented.\nResearchers interested in the history of New England architecture, architectural styles, individual architects, specific buildings or types, ornamental or construction details, garden design, and interior decoration will delight in the collections of more than 20,000 architectural drawings and specifications, American builders' guides, pattern books, and decorating manuals, and trade catalogues and other advertising ephemera that provide useful information about architectural ornament and building materials. The work of more than 450 architects working from c. 1800 until the 1960s is represented.\nThe Library and Archives' collections of family papers and account books provide significant information about New England's social, cultural, economic, agricultural, and literary history. For example, the Codman Family Papers include correspondence from Edith Wharton to Ogden Codman, Jr.; important documents related to the completion of the Washington Monument and the construction of the State, War, and Navy Building and the Library of Congress are part of the Casey Family Papers; the business papers of Harrison Gray Otis (member of Congress 1791-1801 and mayor of Boston 1829-1831) are an important source of information about the development of Boston's Beacon Hill; and the Jewett Family Papers contain correspondence between the noted New England author Sarah Orne Jewett and members of her family.\nThe ephemera collection includes postcards, greeting cards, clippings, programs, broadsides, advertisements, guidebooks, menus, tickets, invitations, rewards of merit, product catalogues, and illustrated invoices. These items are rich in information about material culture, the history of advertising, the evolution of graphic design, and the history of technology.\nThe Library and Archives also holds the institutional archives of Historic New England, which are important as a source of information not only about Historic New England's history and its founder, William Sumner Appleton, but also about the history of the preservation movement in the United States.\nMost of the collections in the Library and Archives have been thoroughly indexed, with multiple points of access.\n\n Usage Discussion\nSuggestions for approaching the material:\nHousing and getting by for less in the area: \n\n\n  Fellowships and Funding Opportunities \n  Major Topic Areas \n\n\n"

Fax (626) 449-5703.\nWeb page: http://www.huntington.org/.\nPresident: Steven S. Koblik\nDirector of Research: Robert \"Roy\" C. Ritchie\nDirector of the Library: David S. Zeidberg\n\n Hours and usage restrictions\nMonday - Saturday, 8:30 AM - 5 PM. You'll need to make an appointment before coming to use the collections, rather than just showing up.\nReaders (the Huntington's term for registered users of the collections) typically must hold the Ph.D. in a relevant field or be advanced to candidacy in one of those fields.\n\n Collection Summary\nThe Huntington Library is a research institution devoted primarily to the study of British, American and Continental history and literature, with specialties in the history of California and the American West, U.S. antebellum and Civil War history, and the history of science, technology and medicine. The library has exceptional collections of manuscripts and rare books in the fields in which it specializes. In American history its holdings of the printed accounts of early explorers are virtually complete; its collections in the period to 1800 number more than 7,000 American imprints as well as extensive manuscript archives; its holdings on the Civil War and the West are among the most extensive in the nation. The library�۪s holdings in British medieval history are unparalleled in the United States; in the postmedieval period its collections include more than 70 percent of all books printed in England before 1641 as well as more than 70 collections of manuscripts. The total number of collections for postmedieval British and American history is more than 800.\nThese historical collections are supplemented by equally extensive holdings of literary and historical books and manuscripts. For American literature there is a remarkable collection of American fiction before 1900 and manuscript collections containing the papers of such notable writers as Jack London and Wallace Stevens. In British literature the collections on the English Renaissance are quite extensive and the later periods are equally well represented with notable collections in theater history.\nTaken as a whole, the rare materials at the Huntington are the most heavily-used of any private research library in North America.\nThe Library also has a notable historic photograph collection, with approximately 600,000 photographs, and with especially rich holdings in the American West.\nThe Burndy History of Science Collection will be available for scholars in the summer of 2008 and will add enormously to the Huntington�۪s already fine history of science holdings. Accompanying the library is the Dibner History of Science Program at the Huntington. This program will fund long- and short-term fellowships, an annual conference, a lecture series, and an ongoing series of seminars.\nOutside of the scope of the Library's holdings but still relevant to researchers is The Huntington and Virginia Steele Scott art galleries, which contain many remarkable paintings. The collections have nearly 50,000 drawings, watercolors, and prints. The spectacular botanical gardens also have their own research library for works on botanical subjects.\n\n Usage Discussion\nSuggestions for approaching the material:\nFor those doing primary source research, use of the Huntington's somewhat idiosyncratic but still-magnificent manuscript card catalog is essential. It's very strong in personal names -- authors and recipients of correspondence -- and should be your first stop in determining what relevant manuscript holdings the library has. Talking to one of the ten subject-specialist curators in the library is also critical, as they know the collections best.\nHousing and getting by for less in the area:\nIf you're on a fellowship (or on your own dime and need local lodging), contact Susi Krasnoo, the person who helps Readers find housing locally -- often inexpensively, via a room rental in San Marino. (skrasnoo@huntington.org; 626-405-3432). The sooner you contact her before your arrival, the better. Summer is by far the busiest time at the Huntington. Also ask other Readers for tips on cheap places to eat; nearby Pasadena has lots of great little hole-in-the-wall eateries as well as something in every cost range and of almost any conceivable type of food.\n\n\n\n"

The archival records of state government are housed at the Margaret Cross Norton Building in Springfield. All three branches of state government are well represented, as there are 2,443 separate functional record series arranged under 191 different offices, departments, divisions, institutions, boards, the legislature, the supreme court, and several federal agencies whose records were transferred officially to the state of Illinois. The archives building contains over 73,000 cubic feet of state government records. The functions of these records were both practical and varied, and as a consequence the subjects with which they dealt were extremely diverse. Database topic entries run from ���abandoned airports�۝ to ���zoning.�۝\nThe state archives administers the Illinois Regional Archives Depository (IRAD) system to manage the archival records of local governments. Based at seven state university campuses, regional depositories house and service those records of local governments that have been appraised as having long-term values and have been transferred to the archives�۪ custody. While one depository is devoted solely to Cook County, the other six include regions made up of from 14 to 23 contiguous counties. Records holdings represent 101 counties and over 200 cities, towns, townships, and villages. In all there are 4,143 individual record series that bulk at 13,910 microfilm rolls and 8,174 cubic feet of materials. These records concern courts, schools, land, taxation, elections, welfare, accounts and audits, inquests, military service, jail prisoners, professional practitioners, births, deaths, marriages, mortgages, naturalizations, and the multifaceted considerations of local boards and councils.\n\n\n Usage Discussion\nSuggestions for approaching the material:\nHousing and getting by for less in the area:\n\n\n\n"

This library includes among other important items a complete collection of the Monumenta Historica Societatis Iesu (presently numbering 158 volumes of critically edited primary source material on the first century and the half of the history of the Society Jesus, (approximately 1540 to 1600), a complete collection of the Bibliotheca Instituti Historici Societatis Iesu  (scholarly studies in most current European languages, presently 60 volumes, on the history of the Society of Jesus and on individual Jesuits, Jesuit projects and persons and movements connected with the Society of Jesus), and a complete collection of the Archivum Historicum Societatis Iesu, (a semi-annual scholarly historical journal appearing since 1932).

From its beginnings in 1846, the library has grown to include 60,000 printed books, major collections of maps and prints, and a large number of codices. (Archival manuscripts, however, generally fall outside the library�۪s collecting policy.) While terminal dates vary from area to area, the collections range from the late 15th century to about 1825, when direct European involvement in American affairs came to an end. Approximately 20 percent of the collection consists of books printed before 1700. The following survey, by no means exhaustive, suggests some applications of these resources.\nThe original European travel narratives concerning both North and South America, from the early Spanish chronicles onwards, are substantially complete and form the point of departure for the collection. Numerous works dealing with native peoples of North and South America, including both printed and manuscript works on Indian languages, offer opportunities for work in anthropology, archaeology, and linguistics. A wide range of colonial architecture books, prints on American themes, and English cartoons and caricatures from the 18th century are available to art historians. Economic history is widely represented in works illustrating the impact of the Americas on economic theory, commerce, investment, landholding, monetary policies, taxation, and labor. A large group of cosmographical and geographical works, atlases, and maps offers unusual opportunities for research in the history of geography and cartography. Maritime history is also one of the library�۪s specialties, as is the history of Brazil. The library holds early editions of literary works on New World themes by English, Spanish, French, Portuguese, Italian, German, and Dutch authors. Numerous legal works reflect the response of European legal systems to the growth of overseas empires and in particular deal with the development of international law. A major collection centers on the adaptation of religion and religious institutions to the New World, with particular strength in works concerning the activities of the Franciscans, the Jesuits, and other missionary orders, and of Puritans and Anglicans in New England. An important group of works on natural history records the appearance of American plants and their use as food and medicine. Pamphlet literature of the U.S. Revolution for Independence is a library specialty, and the library holds the largest collection in the United States of printed material relating to the Chilean revolution for independence in the early 19th century.

Among the more extensive collections are those of T.Z.R. Jones, an early missionary preacher in Michigan and longtime financial agent of both the Michigan Baptist Convention and Kalamazoo College; E.J.

The Archivist and student workers staff the Archives approximately 20 hours a week during the Fall, Winter, and Spring quarters. Arrangements must be made with the Archivist or Reference Librarians for access at other times. The Archives is closed for public access during the summer.\nMaterials must be used in the Archives under supervised conditions. It is possible for materials to be left in the Reference Area for individuals who are unable to visit the Archives during open hours or who wish to continue their research beyond those times. The materials used under these circumstances are generally not of a confidential nature. Individuals must have made prior arrangements so that materials may be transferred from the Archives to the Reference Office. It is not the responsibility of the supervisor on duty to retrieve Archives materials. Materials used in the Reference Area should be returned to the supervisor on duty.\nConfidentiality\nThe Kalamazoo College Archives is committed to providing researchers with the material they need. However, due to the confidential nature of certain records, access to some materials may be limited. Restrictions are placed on the use of records in order to protect the rights to privacy of individuals and the institution. Researchers may be required to obtain permission from the office of origin before using unpublished materials.\nThe following materials may be consulted without restriction:\n\n Audiocassettes\n Baptist Collection\n Blueprints\n College publications (Index, yearbooks, alumni magazines, catalogs, etc.)\n Memorabilia\n Photographs\n Other published materials\n Videos\n Materials available to the general College community at the time of their original distribution\n\nSee the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA).

Subject matter includes, but is not limited to, biographical and genealogical information, businesses, institutions, and buildings. Although the primary focus is on the local area, there are also materials available on the history of Michigan.\nTypes of materials available at the Local History Room include the following.\n\nBooks\nDiaries and manuscripts\nNewspapers (microfilm and digitized)\nClipping files and scrapbooks\nMaps (physical and microfilm)\nPeriodicals (physical and microfilm)\nCorporate and institutional records\nPhotographs\n\nThe holdings of the Local History Room are searchable via the Library's online catalog. However, when accessing the catalog make sure to select the \"Search Local Information\" link on the left. Most print materials and files are cataloged, as well as many photographs.\n\n Research procedures\n Access\nThe Local History Room is open to all members of the public. A Kalamazoo Public Library card is not required to access materials. Appointments are not required, but if you know beforehand what materials or subject matter you wish to research, it can be helpful to contact Local History Room staff prior to your visit.\nMany materials are located within the Local History Room's reading room. However some materials, including fragile documents and photographs, are located in locked cabinets and will require a staff member's assistance to access. Additionally, other materials are stored in a non-public storage facility and will also require a staff member to access. Requests are fulfilled promptly.\nAlthough most of its collection is cataloged and is searchable, Local History Room also holds a number of uncataloged photographs and manuscripts in storage. If the staff person knows what subjects you are interested in, they can provide access to such materials that may be relevant.\n\n Permitted and prohibited items\nPermitted: Laptop computers, cameras, pens and pencils, note paper.\nProhibited: Phones, food and beverages.\n\n Document ordering and delivery\nPhotocopies, microprints, and scans of materials may be requested by phone, mail, or email.

These fees include postage. More information on document delivery may be found at the following link.\nhttp://kpl.gov/local-history/order-materials.aspx\n\n Photocopying, photography, microfilming\nA photocopier and computer printer are available within the Local History Room. Additionally, a microfilm reader with printer is also available. Copies may be made at moderate costs. Photographing materials is permitted as long as it is for personal use and no flash is used.\n\n Practicalities\n Parking and Transportation\nThere are several paid city-owned parking lots and ramps within a short walking distance from the Library. The ramps are the best solution for long visits. One parking lot is located directly adjacent to the Library on Rose Street, but given the rates and time limits of that lot it is not ideal for long visits. Two hour metered street parking is also available throughout much of the downtown district, as well as some ninety minute free spots. A parking map is available here.\nhttp://kpl.gov/central/map.aspx\nThe City of Kalamazoo operates a bus system, with stops adjacent to the Library. The main passenger train and bus station is located three blocks north of the Library.\n\n Food\nA number of restaurants and coffee shops are located within a short of the Library. Most can be found along the Kalamazoo Mall/Burdick Street, which is one block east of the Library. Further establishments are located along Michigan Avenue, two blocks north. Fare runs the range from fast food to fine dining and from inexpensive to expensive.\nDining options are more limited on Sundays, as many of the establishments are closed or have limited hours.\n\n Facilities and Services\nThe Local History Room is located on the second floor and can be accessed both by stairs and elevator. Restrooms are located just outside of the entrance to the room. The Kalamazoo Public Library offers free wifi to patrons and a library card is not necessary to access it.\n\n See also\nhttp://www.kpl.gov/\nhttp://kpl.gov/local-history/all-about-kalamazoo/\n\n\n\n"

The Collection provides researchers with primary source materials that document the \"Kansas Experience.\" The bulk of the Collection's holdings cover the territorial period (1854-1861) to the present. Materials beyond Kansas include documentation from the contiguous states and the Great Plains generally. The Kansas Collection also contains significant holdings that document the African American experience in the state. The Wilcox Collection is one of the largest assemblages of US left and right wing political literature in this country.\nSpecial Collections contains a wide range of rare books and manuscripts. Its primary charge is the collection and preservation of original sources for use by students and scholars of the humanities, the history of science, and the history of the book. Special Collections holds volumes printed since the mid-fifteenth century, with major emphasis on sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Europe, eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Great Britain, and twentieth-century America. Other times and places are often extensively represented, especially in the general rare books collection. Special Collections manuscripts date from Antiquity to the present. The major regions covered are Britain, Europe, Latin America (to a lesser degree), and the U.S. (primarily for some minor literary genres). A few items fall outside these subject/time/locality boundaries. Special Collections holdings include one of the most extensive collections of Irish literature outside of Ireland.\n\n\n Usage Discussion\nSuggestions for approaching the material: When searching the KU Libraries online catalog, researchers can use the \"Set Other Search Limits\" function to restrict results to items held at Spencer Research Library.

The collection does, however, include the three extant state constitutions, written in 1792, 1799, and 1891. Letters, diaries, church records, business records, broadsides, handbills, and literary manuscripts shed light on the lives of Kentuckians in early times. More than 2,000 historical maps document Kentucky�۪s pioneer heritage and changing boundaries. KHS special collections also maintains photographic collections of more than 200,000 images. Holdings include strong collections of architectural prints and negatives, particularly from the 1920s and 1930s. The rare book collection includes early published state documents, legislative journals, and a complete set of Kentucky Acts. The Kentucky Oral History Commission holdings in special collections number more than 8,000 interviews, making it one of the largest oral history collections in the country.\nThe Martin F.

      "Archive_Info": "The La Guardia and Wagner Archives was established in 1982 to collect, preserve, and make available primary materials documenting the social and political history of New York City, with an emphasis on the mayoralty and the borough of Queens. The archives serves a broad array of researchers, journalists, students, scholars, exhibit planners, and policy makers examining the history of Greater New York.

Hours for researchers are Monday to Friday, 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Those interested in using the collections should call or e-mail for an appointment.\n\n Collection Summary\nThis growing repository contains the papers of several mayors, the records of the New York City Council, the New York City Housing Authority, the piano maker Steinway & Sons, and a Queens History Collection.\nFiorello H. La Guardia Collection: As mayor during the turbulent period from 1934 to 1945, Fiorello H. La Guardia initiated major reforms that alleviated human suffering during the Great Depression and World War II. In 1982, the mayor�۪s widow, the late Marie La Guardia, donated her husband�۪s personal papers to La Guardia Community College. These documents, photographs, and personal artifacts chronicle Mayor La Guardia�۪s life and times, providing an invaluable record of New York City history.\nThe collection contains transcripts of La Guardia�۪s speeches, personal correspondence, and more than 3,000 photographs. It also has original sketches, scrapbooks, and records of his tenure as director general of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration after World War II. The archives holds a microfilm copy of selected series of La Guardia�۪s mayoral papers housed at the New York City Municipal Archives. This includes the mayor�۪s scrapbooks, which record the media�۪s reaction to La Guardia and the issues of the time. The archives has available a microfilm copy of La Guardia�۪s congressional papers, which are housed at the New York Public Library. The collection contains more than 100 hours of audio and video tapes of and about La Guardia, including oral history interviews with the mayor�۪s friends and associates, La Guardia�۪s radio broadcasts, and newsreel footage.\nRobert F. Wagner Collection: Mayor Robert F. Wagner was the second generation of the Wagner family to devote himself to public service. His father, U.S. Senator Robert F. Wagner, a major figure on the national scene in the New Deal era, sponsored landmark labor, civil rights, health, social security, and social welfare legislation. The mayor�۪s son, Robert F. Wagner Jr., served as a member of the New York City Council, chair of the New York City Planning Commission, deputy mayor for policy, and president of the New York City Board of Education.\nMayor Robert F. Wagner served as chief executive of New York City for three terms. From 1954 to 1965, he oversaw the construction of housing, parks, roadways, and schools. He championed the growth and empowerment of municipal labor unions, and sponsored the creation of the City University of New York. He mobilized resources for the War on Poverty and ventured into new fields in income redistribution for the benefit of lower income groups and individuals. He used city government to combat housing bias and job discrimination.\nAll of these activities, programs, and concepts are reflected in the Wagner Collection, which consists of correspondence (including microfilm of materials held by the Municipal Archives), transcripts of 3,000 speeches, over 6,000 photographs, personal artifacts, and a 100-interview oral history collection. In addition, portions of Senator Robert F. Wagner�۪s papers, held by Georgetown University, are available on microfilm. In 1994, the archives received the personal papers of Robert F. Wagner Jr., documenting the third and final generation of the Wagner family to serve in a public role.\nAbraham D. Beame Collection: Abraham Beame enjoyed a long and distinguished career in public service, including a term as mayor, 1974���77. The Beame Collection consists of 1,700 photographs, more than 100 artifacts, and an assortment of papers documenting key themes of the Beame years. These include the fiscal crisis of the 1970s and the bicentennial celebration. The Beame oral history project has gathered unique recollections of more than 30 associates and contemporaries of the mayor.\nEdward I. Koch Collection: The archives is acquiring the personal papers of Edward Koch. New York�۪s dynamic 105th mayor served three terms, 1978���89. This collection of postmayoral materials includes 1,300 photographs, videos, and a variety of documents. Included in the collection are materials donated by contemporaries and associates of the mayor, facilitating research on such issues as charter revision and economic development. Dozens of oral history transcripts offer insights into major public issues of the Koch years. A microfilm copy of the Koch Departmental Correspondence, held by the Municipal Archives, is available as well.\nNew York City Council: This collection represents an unparalleled snapshot of the legislative history of America�۪s biggest city from the 1930s and into the 21st century. It includes not only copies of the thousands of enacted laws and official publications, but also the records of public hearings and committee files on legislation under consideration and ad hoc investigations, thousands of photographs and negatives, maps, artifacts, scrapbooks, audio and videotapes, as well as the papers of dozens of individual council members, including former leaders Newbold Morris, Joseph Sharkey, Paul Screvane, and Peter Vallone, among others. Three one-time council members rose to the mayoralty of New York City: Fiorello La Guardia, Vincent Impellitteri, and Edward Koch. This collection gives a vivid picture of day-to-day life in the city, focusing on constituency issues close to ordinary people such as housing, drugs, crime, welfare, community development, health, and the environment. It also provides historians with a wider understanding of a local government that is frequently overshadowed in the media by the prominence of a powerful mayor. Legislative documents from 1955 to 1997 are viewable on the web site, which also contains more than 6,000 searchable photographs.\nNew York City Housing Authority: The archives is the repository of the New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA). Founded in 1934, NYCHA was the first housing authority in the United States. The authority manages 344 projects housing more than 413,000 people. The collection covers the period from the late 1920s to the early 1990s. It documents the construction of New York�۪s public housing projects and provides information about the lives of the residents. Most major themes in the social history of 20th-century New York can be studied through the records. The collection contains correspondence, reports, news clippings, testimony, and surveys of neighborhoods and tenant populations. It also has more than 50,000 images, including photos of city neighborhoods before the projects were built. About 4,700 can be viewed online. In addition, there is a special online presentation, ���How Public Housing Transformed New York.�۝ A small oral history collection preserves the thoughts and comments of NYCHA staff members.\nSteinway & Sons: Henry Z. Steinway donated the papers of the Steinway & Sons piano company to the archives in 1985. The Steinway company figures prominently in American immigration, business, cultural, urban and labor history. The Steinways first made pianos in Germany. Migrating to America, the family founded a piano company in New York City in 1853. The Steinway piano has an international reputation for technical innovation and musical quality. In 1870, Steinway & Sons built a factory in Queens and constructed street railways and housing, contributing to the county�۪s growth and development. The Steinway & Sons Collection consists of family, business, and workers�۪ records from 1853 to 1973. The collection also contains nearly 4,000 photographs, including several signed prints by the famed photographer Margaret Bourke-White, and more than 50 hours of audio and videotapes. In 1995, the archives acquired a restored 1858 Steinway square piano, which is now part of the collection.\nQueens History Collection: The archives houses a collection on the social history of Queens from the late 19th century to the late 20th century. This includes a 2,000-image photo collection. It contains views of transportation, leisure, work, and family life in New York�۪s largest borough. The history of Astoria, Long Island City, and Woodside are especially well documented in this collection. The images show the transformation from a rural county in the late 19th century to an urban borough by 1950. The collection also has more than 90 oral histories on everyday life in Queens. An additional aspect of this collection is the papers of two settlement houses located in Queens, Forest Hills Community House and Sunnyside Community Services. These collections shed light on a variety of important themes in the social history of post���World War II Queens, including race relations and demographic changes.\nIn the future, the archives will continue to strengthen its resources as a center for the study of modern New York City. In addition, the archives is working to acquire microfilm copies of the papers of all of the 20th-century mayors of New York City.\n\n\n Usage Discussion\nSuggestions for approaching the material:\nHousing and getting by for less in the area:\n\n\n\n"

Some books, positive microfilms, and photocopies of journal articles may be requested through Interlibrary Loan.\nThe Reading Room is open from 10:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. during the week and from 10:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. on Saturdays; during the academic vacations, weekday hours are usually restricted to the afternoon.\n\n  Online Catalogs and Finding Aids \nThe Special Collections Library has a finding aid online: http://quod.lib.umich.edu/s/sclead/\n\n Collection Summary\nThe Labadie Collection was established in 1911 when Joseph Labadie, a prominent Detroit anarchist, donated his library to the University of Michigan. Although the Collection was originally concerned mainly with anarchist materials (the field in which it remains strongest), its scope was later widened considerably to include a great variety of social protest literature together with political views from both the extreme left and the extreme right. Materials are now collected from all parts of the world. In addition to anarchism, the Collection's strengths include: civil liberties (with an emphases on racial minorities), socialism, communism, colonialism and imperialism, American labor history through the 1930s, the IWW, the Spanish Civil War, sexual freedom, women's liberation, gay liberation, the underground press, and student protest.\nAlthough the Labadie Collection contains 35,000 books and 8,000 periodicals (including nearly 800 currently received titles), it is justly famous for its ephemera. There are nearly 6,000 subject vertical files, consisting principally of brochures, leaflets, clippings, and reprints. Seven hundred posters illustrate aspects of protest, a number of which were used in 1995 for the online exhibit, Anarchist Images: Posters from the Labadie Collection. A like number of photographs may be found in the collection, for the most part consisting of portraits of people prominent in the anarchist movement. In 1999, under the auspices of the University of Michigan Digital Library Initiative, this rich collection of photographs was digitized and mounted on the web. They may be viewed via a link on the Labadie Collection's main page. \n\n Usage Discussion\nSuggestions for approaching the material:\nHousing and getting by for less in the area: \n\n\n  Fellowships and Funding Opportunities \n  Major Topic Areas \n\n\n"

Thousands of family, business, institutional, and community records touch upon virtually every phase of German Jewish life during the past 200 years. Material in the archives relates not only to famous names of the past; a unique collection of 1,100 memoirs and more than 30,000 photographs mirrors the life of the average Jew.\nOne hundred twenty paintings as well as several thousand drawings and prints further enhance the significance of the institute as an impressive repository of the cultural legacy of German-speaking Jewry.\n\n Usage Discussion\nSuggestions for approaching the material:\nHousing and getting by for less in the area:\n\n\n\n"

Van Horne\nOnline Finding Aid:\nArchivists (principal contacts for advice on the collection):\n\n Hours and usage restrictions\n Collection Summary\nThe Library Company of Philadelphia is an independent research library with collections documenting every aspect of the history and background of American culture from the colonial period to the Civil War. A rare book collection of national importance, its holdings number 450,000 books, 75,000 graphics, and 160,000 manuscripts. These collections are available to all serious researchers without charge.\nFrom its founding in 1731 through the 19th century, the Library Company actively collected books, newspapers, pamphlets, and prints, British and continental as well as American, reflecting all the varied interests of its learned and cosmopolitan clientele. These materials have been reorganized to form an unparalleled collection of primary research materials, constantly augmented by gift and purchase, which provides a comprehensive representation of American print culture in the 18th and 19th centuries. The following areas receive particular attention: Afro-Americana; American science, technology, architecture, agriculture, natural history, education, philanthropy, and medicine; business and economic history; German-Americana; American Judaica; Philadelphia area history; the history of printing, book collecting, and reading; women�۪s history; household and family life; popular literature; and printmaking, mapmaking, and photography in Philadelphia.\nThe Library Company maintains a reciprocal housing agreement with the Historical Society of Pennsylvania in which the historical society�۪s rare book collection is housed in the Library Company and the Library Company�۪s manuscript collection is housed in the historical society. Included in the Library Company�۪s manuscripts are several important collections: the papers of Pierre Eug̬ne Du Simiti̬re, an 18th-century ephemera collector and artist; Benjamin Rush, the physician and Revolutionary War patriot; and John A. McAllister, an early Philadelphia antiquarian.\nThere is a relatively small museum collection of paintings, sculpture, furniture, and an assortment of relics and objects dating from the 18th century (when the library maintained a ���cabinet of curiosities�۝ for research purposes) through the 1890s. Many of the items are displayed in public areas of the library.\nReaders are assisted in their research by a knowledgeable staff. The Library Company provides a web site for further information about the library and its collections, with links to an online catalog of records for books, prints, serials, broadsides, and collections (WolfPAC) and to a second catalog for digital image collections (ImPAC).\n\n Usage Discussion\nSuggestions for approaching the material:\nHousing and getting by for less in the area:\n\n\n\n"

The library collection includes many early travel accounts and the first printed records of the colony as well as thousands of works by Virginia authors. A fine corpus of Confederate imprints supports an outstanding collection of Civil War history. A comprehensive collection of published local history and genealogy supplements the archives�۪ extensive county and city circuit court records, including original deeds, wills, order books, case files, and loose court papers dating from the 1600s through the 1940s. The official repository for all state records, the archives provide access to the surviving records of Virginia�۪s colonial and revolutionary-era governments, the governor�۪s office and the executive branch, the General Assembly, constitutional conventions from 1776 to 1969, the state judiciary, and many independent state agencies. Manuscript holdings also include a wide variety of personal papers, business records, genealogical notes and charts, family Bibles, church records, organizational records, and maps. Online catalogs to the collections are available at the library�۪s web site, and printed inventories and guides to many of the library�۪s major collections are available.\nThe Library of Virginia�۪s web site provides efficient and extensive access to research materials. Among the databases available on the library�۪s web site are Revolutionary War bounty records, legislative petitions, Confederate pension applications, Board of Public Works maps, and indexes to Virginia estate and probate records before 1800 and to marriages and obituaries. Other online collections include Land Office patents and grants, family Bible records, the survey reports of the Virginia Colonial Records Project, and the WPA Virginia Historical Inventory of photographs, maps, and detailed reports documenting the architectural, cultural, and family histories of thousands of 18th- and 19th-century buildings in communities across Virginia. A strength of the digital collection is 20th-century Virginia history, with the World War I History Questionnaires, the WPA Virginia Writers Project life histories, and the photographs of the 1939 World�۪s Fair Collection and the Army Signal Corps�۪ Hampton Roads Embarkation Series, 1942���46.\n\n Usage Discussion\nSuggestions for approaching the material:\nThey have microfilm available through inter-library loan for some of their collection.  Check with staff for details.  Requests for print-outs from microfilm require a $25-30 service fee that also includes three pages of printing.  Additional print-outs are $3 per page.  If travel to the repository is not possible, it may be cheaper to hire one of the free-lance researchers they list on their site.\nHousing and getting by for less in the area:\n\n\n\n"

Closed Saturday, Sunday, and on Federal holidays.\nAdmission is free.\n\n\n Collection Summary\nThe Library holds more than 45 million documents, an extensive audiovisual collection, and 1,500 oral history interviews. The papers of Lyndon B. Johnson, which form the core of the Library's holdings, include the White House files of his presidency, 1963-1969, and papers from his service as a U.S. Congressman, 1937-1949; U.S. Senator, 1949-1961; and Vice President, 1961-1963.\nIn addition, the Library holds the papers of several hundred other individuals, including family, friends, and associates of Lyndon B. Johnson and members of his presidential administration. \n\n\n Usage Discussion\nContact the library via email to discuss your research needs - although the contact info on their website is a general email address, they'll direct your query to the appropriate staff member.\nStaff members have been very helpful in advance of archival visits. For example, they'll send copies of (specialized) finding aids (eg, \"Holdings Related to Women\") so that you have a good idea coming in.\nAlso offers fellowships for research - definitely worth applying!\nAs of January 2009, there is construction around most of the building. If you are coming from the opposite side of campus, you will need to go around the fencing to reach the entry.\nBecause of construction (presumably), you enter on the third floor. Tell staff at the desk that you have an appointment with the reading room, and they will call up to let them know you're coming (or may escort you).\nBring a photo ID. You will receive a blue researcher card (standard issue at several presidential libraries). Expect 45 minutes to an hour for your initial orientation with an archivist.\n\"Fetches\" (box pulls) happen at 9:15, 10:15, 11:15, 1:15, 2:15, 3:15, and 4:15. If you arrive in the 12 o'clock hour, they'll supposedly go ahead and pull for you.\nStaff are very friendly, helpful, and easy to work with.\nNote: they have 2 \"digital camera\" stations. If you don't bring your own, apparently you can use theirs - but it appears to have a fee associated with it.\nResearch room is walled with glass on one side, so you can see the large lockers clearly - plenty of room to store a carry-on if you're coming to/from the airport.\nCab fare from the airport is about $25 one way, or you can take Super Shuttle for about $13 each way.\nWhere to stay??\n-University of Texas-Austin has a hotel on campus, but it's pricey.\n-Try Google Maps: put in the library address and do a search for hotels or B&Bs. \n-Star of Texas Inn is about a mile away - just across campus. This is very walkable, and at about $90 per night for lodging and breakfast, the price isn't bad. (Their sister facility, Austin Folk House, is a block closer to the university.)\nWhere to eat?\n-Library staff will happily give you recommendations. Not far away - just across a major road, and fortunately OFF campus - there's Longhorn Po'boys, which serves a wide array of food with a lot of Middle Eastern influence (the gyros are good; they have burgers, salads, and other sandwiches on the menu, too).\nWhen to go?\n-You might check the University of Texas-Austin academic calendar to make sure you don't overlap with big events like football, commencement, or start of the school year.\n-Football is obviously HUGE here: the stadium is much better than even an NFL facility. This shouldn't be much of an obstacle, though, since games are on weekends and the archive is closed on Saturday/Sunday.\n-Summer will be very, very hot. If you're not used to Texas weather, expect HOT. In early January 2009, weather included days with 70-degree highs. (If you come from where it's cold, this can be a nice winter relief.)\nDo I need a car?\n-Not necessarily. If you stay near campus, there are plenty of food options in walking distance. On the flip side, the archive will give you a parking permit (no charge), if needed. A car might be nice if you want to explore the area, but it's not absolutely required. NOTE: in March 2009, Austin will be starting a light-rail line. Unsure at this time about extent of that transportation option (does not seem to go to the airport).\n\n\n\n"

The collection began as an initiative to collect, preserve, and make available original research materials pertaining to New York State public affairs and policy, and now includes the personal papers of members of the gubernatorial administrations of Nelson A. Rockefeller; papers of 20 former New York Congressional members and 41 elected officials who served in New York State Legislature; and the official records and personal papers of more than 200 private groups, professional associations, individuals, public-sector labor unions, community groups, and other organizations concerned with Empire State public-policy issues. The Archives of Public Affairs and Policy consists of over five thousand cubic feet of historical records, photographs, film, audiotapes, microfilm, and other record forms. Archival materials are available in a number of subject areas including: African Americans and Civil Rights Organizations; Conservation and the Environment; Criminal Justice and Prisons; the Death Penalty; Education; Human Sexuality and Gender Identity; Labor; Neighborhood Associations; Public Servants and Politicians; Social Activists and Public Advocates; Women; as well as other emerging public policy issues.\nGerman and Jewish Intellectual Emigre Collection: The German and Jewish Intellectual ��migr̩ Collection is comprised of over 95 collections (approximately 750 cubic feet) of personal papers, organizational records, tape recordings, photographs, and related research materials documenting the German intellectual exodus of the 1930s and 1940s. To complement the successful collecting efforts of other libraries and archival repositories in the United States and the German Federal Republic, the ��migr̩ Collection has focused on the careers and accomplishments of social scientists (economists, sociologists, anthropologists, and political scientists), humanists (historians, philosophers, sinologists, and musicologists), writers (novelists, poets, journalists, critics, political writers, and publishers), creative artists (composers, musical performers, and artists), and others. One of the principal focal points of the ��migr̩ Collection is papers of former faculty members at the University in Exile, now the Graduate Faculty of Political and Social Science of the New School University in New York City.\nUniversity Archives: The University Archives was established in 1971 to document the history of the University at Albany, SUNY from its origin in 1844 as the New York State Normal School to train teachers for New York State to its present status as a comprehensive research university. Administered as an integral part of the M.E. Granander Department of Special Collections and Archives, the University Archives are available to patrons for research and study. The University Archives consists of the Official Records of the University at Albany and its predecessor institutions from its origins in 1844 to the present. Includes presidential papers, trustees and senate minutes, theses and dissertations, photographs, building plans, student and alumini records, publications, and other documentation. Also includes records of the Milne School, the University Teaching School from 1845 - 1977. \nBusiness, Literary, and Miscellany Collections: Chiefly 19th-century New York and New England local history manuscripts and business records, primarily for craftsmen and railroads; papers of children's book writer and illustrator Marcia J. Brown and two original manuscripts by Maud and Miska Petersham; papers of Pulitzer Prize-winning author William Kennedy; papers of Anthony Ashley Cooper, the 19th century social reformer; and papers of Benito Perez Galdos, Gonzalo Torrente Ballester, Evengi Zamyatin, and other writers.\n\n\n\n"

In 2008, the dates the library will be closed on Saturdays are: Saturday, 24 May (Memorial Day weekend), Saturday, 30 August (Labor Day weekend), and Friday and Saturday, 21-22 November (the days following Thanksgiving). The library also is closed from noon on Christmas Eve through New Years Day (24 December-1 January 2009).\nSee the library's Hours & Directions page for detailed directions to the MHS.\nFirst-time visitors to the library should review the Visiting the Library page, which contains most relevant MHS policies and procedures.\n\n Collection Summary\nThe society�۪s collections cannot be matched either in scope or in depth by those of any similar American institution. The area of primary interest is the manuscript collection of more than 12 million pieces in 3,600 separate collections of personal papers and institutional records. These holdings, exceeded in quality only by those of the Library of Congress, cover such diverse subjects as the history of religion, law, education, and medicine; diplomacy and international commerce; the American Revolution and the Civil War; and environmental and women�۪s history. Although the holdings in the history of New England and in the period from colonization through the late 19th century are especially strong, the society also has significant materials for the study of the West Indies, Latin America, the China trade, and the 20th century.\nThe society holds 200,000 published items for early Massachusetts printing and New England local history. A number of special libraries of rare books and manuscripts, several of them given by 19th-century collectors, augment these holdings. Published materials include more than 20,000 broadsides, 30,000 18th- and 19th-century pamphlets, 5,000 maps, and more than 150,000 microforms. The society also houses more than 100,000 historic photographs.\nSee the Library Collections section of the MHS website for more information.\n\n Usage Discussion\nFellowships: The Massachusetts Historical Society now offers more assistance than ever before to the researchers who need to use its collections. In addition to approximately 20 short-term fellowships, the Society will help to provide at least 11 New England Regional Fellowship Consortium grants for projects that draw on the resources of several participating institutions, and at least two long-term MHS-NEH fellowships for study at the MHS. Each summer the Society offers 2-3 fellowships for K-12 teachers. During 4 weeks of on-site research at the MHS, teachers prepare a curriculum or comparable project based on primary documents to enhance instruction in American history, language arts, or science. Please see the Fellowships section of the MHS website for more information about the various fellowships. \n\nResearch Guide\n\nWhat to Bring: Readers may bring only personal computers or digital cameras into the reading room. The reading room staff will provide you with pencils and colored note paper. We do not allow pens, notebooks, and folders, as well as backpacks, briefcases, bags, and outer clothing of any kind in the reading room. Free lockers are available to store personal property. The library staff must approve any additional material or equipment in advance of bringing it into the reading room.\n\nDigital Photography: Non-flash digital photography is permitted in the MHS reading room with the approval of the Reference Librarian. Advanced notice is required to photograph materials requiring special handling or lighting, and permission to do so will be granted at the discretion of the Librarian. Readers must fill out a form listing all digital photographs taken.\n\nWireless Internet Access: The MHS offers free wireless internet access in the public areas of the its building, including the reading room. You will need a laptop or PDA equipped with a Wifi card supporting \"WEP\" encryption (most WiFi cards support this standard). The password for WiFi access changes periodically. Please see a Librarian for more information and access instructions, including the current password. Please note we do not lend WiFi cards to readers. We also can provide wired jacks on an as-needed basis.\n\nPhotocopying: The Massachusetts Historical Society will photocopy research materials from the collections with some restrictions. The staff will not make copies of printed materials protected by copyright, or items regardless of date that are too fragile to copy. Researchers must fill out a photocopy request form listing all manuscript items they wish to have copied. Library staff will review the request and will photocopy materials as time permits. A limit of 20 pages per day normally applies for each reader's requests. Researchers may not photocopy materials themselves. We do not copy materials that are available in another format (facsimiles or microfilms). If the staff is unable to complete a photocopy order during normal library hours, copies will be held for, or mailed to the researcher. The price of all photocopies, including mail orders and paper copies made from microfilms, is $0.50 per copy. There is a minimum charge of $10.00 for all copy orders placed by email, post, or telephone. Large orders or orders that require additional staff preparation will incur an additional processing fee of $15.00 per hour. Estimates for any additional fees will be arranged in advance.\n\nRights and Reproductions: Please see the Rights & Reproductions section of the MHS website for detailed information on requesting permission to cite from manuscript collections, ordering images, and obtaining permission to publish images from MHS collections.\n\nMicrofilm Purchases\n\nInterlibrary Loan: The MHS does not loan original manuscript or printed materials. The MHS holds duplicate positive copies of more than 100 collections microfilmed by the Society. When available, the MHS will loan entire small film sets or portions of large film sets for 30-day periods. Please see the Microfilm Loan Procedures section of the MHS website for more information.\n\n\n\n"

      "Archive_Info": "The Mennonite Historical Library is one of the world�۪s most comprehensive collections related to Anabaptist and Mennonite history. \nOn June 13, 1906, the Alumni Association of Goshen College passed a resolution to establish a Mennonite Historical Library. The collection grew slowly, occupying only three shelves in the college library by 1927. About this time Harold S. Bender and Ernst Correll revived the Mennonite Historical Society and through it began a campaign to collect Anabaptist-Mennonite historical materials. The acquisition of the John F. Funk library in 1930 and the major part of the historical collection from the Mennonite Publishing House at Scottdale, Pa., in the 1940s greatly enriched the collection. The latter, maintained as a memorial to the Mennonite historian John Horsch, is particularly rich in Reformation materials.\nThe library includes bibliographies, texts and images on topics related to the Radical Reformation, the Anabaptists, Hutterites, Mennonites, Amish and various related groups.\n\n\nContents\n\n1 Orientation\n\n1.1 Coordinates\n1.2 Schedule & hours\n1.3 English (German, Spanish, French)\n1.4 Directions to the library\n\n\n2 Holdings\n3 Research procedures\n\n3.1 Access\n3.2 Permitted and prohibited items\n3.3 Document ordering and delivery\n3.4 Photocopying, photography, microfilming\n\n\n4 Key individuals\n5 Practicalities\n6 See also\n\n\n Orientation\n Coordinates\nGoshen College, 1700 S.

MHL staff can read or converse in English, German, Dutch, French, Russian and Spanish.\n\n Directions to the library\n Holdings\nThe on-line catalog includes book, video, and journal titles\nlocated in the Good Library. The Good Library catalog includes the\nMennonite Historical Library collection. Books from the MHL\ncollection are labeled \"Goshen - MHL\", all other materials\nare located in the Good Library. You may also search the catalogs of\n24 other private college, seminary, and university libraries in\nIndiana (PALNI).\n\n Research procedures\n Access\nThe library provides special carrels for scholars doing research for extended periods, enabling researchers to work evenings, except during college vacation periods. Laptop computers may be used in these carrels. Microfilm readers and a photocopier are available, but there are no facilites for producing microfilms.\nThe staff is pleased to exhibit and explain parts of the library's resources and to give talks about the collection to interested individuals and groups. Members of the staff will help researchers in any way they can.\nInquiries by mail and e-mail (mhl@goshen.edu) will be answered as staff time permits. The serious researcher will find it more advantageous to visit the library and examine the collection in person. The library usually has more resources relating to a research project than can be determined by correspondence, and many of the library's materials do not circulate.\n\n\n Permitted and prohibited items\nLaptop computers, cameras, pens and pencils, loose papers are all permitted in the MHL.\n\n Document ordering and delivery\n(how do you request documents?  how many can you order at a time? how are documents delivered?)\n\n Photocopying, photography, microfilming\n(what are costs, permits, and page limits?  how long do you have to wait?)\n\n Key individuals\nJohn D.

The reference library provides access to books, pamphlets, periodicals, newspapers, maps and atlases, photographs, posters, works of art, moving images, oral histories and other sound recordings, manuscripts, and state and local government archives. The museum collections include three-dimensional objects and archaeological artifacts.\nThe library contains the nation�۪s largest collection of published materials on Minnesota as well as the Upper Mississippi Valley and the Great Lakes areas, including more than 500,000 volumes; 37,000 cubic feet of manuscripts; 54,000 feet of government records including over 11,000 microfilm reels; and 4,000,000 issues of 4,100 newspapers, most of the newspapers published in Minnesota since 1849, the majority on microfilm and available on Interlibrary Loan. [1]\nThe manuscript collection originated in 1868 when the society received the papers of Lawrence Taliaferro, U.S. Indian agent at Fort Snelling from 1819 to 1839. There are now more than 6,000 collections composed of diaries, letters, account books, reminiscences, scrapbooks, minutes, and other unpublished materials. \nThe collection holds the papers of Hubert H. Humphrey[2], Walter F. Mondale[3], the James J. Hill Family[4], Henry H. Sibley[5], Bishop Henry B. Whipple[6], and other Minnesotans who have made an impact on national life, including Ignatius Donnelly[7], Frank B. Kellogg, Charles A. Lindbergh[8], Harold Stassen[9] Eugene McCarthy[10], Maurice Stans[11], Orville Freeman, Max Kampelman[12], Bruce Laignen[13], Meridel LeSueur[14], and Ernst Oberholtzer[15]. Along with the records documenting the history of the Great Northern[16] and Northern Pacific[17] railroads are major collections on lumbering, flour milling, manufacturing (3M Company[18], Andersen Corporation[19], Minneapolis-Moline, Munsingwear[20]), airlines, and private philanthropy. Other areas of particular strength are labor,[21] the cooperative movement,[22] 19th-century family life, conservation, and the environment.[23] The society also preserves and administers the Minnesota State Archives,[24] which includes papers from every governor since 1849,[25] the legislature, and state agencies, as well as county and local government records. \nAn extensive grouping of maps, art, photographs, film, phonodiscs, and oral histories is also part of the society�۪s collections. The map collection[26] consists of about 19,000 maps and 2,000 atlases with an emphasis on Minnesota and the Midwest, and includes maps of North America, Canada, and the United States dating from the 16th century. The art collection[27] contains more than 6,100 paintings, drawings, and sculptures from the early 19th century to the present. More than 500,000 historical photographs[28] dating from the 1840s are available for research as is a collection of fine art photography. The film,[29] videotape, and record collections document 20th-century history. The oral history collection[30] includes 1,500 recorded interviews documenting environmental issues, agriculture, the resort industry, current immigration, politics, labor, business, and ethnic groups.\nMuseum collections[31] consist of over 260,000 three-dimensional objects dating from the early 1800s to the present and ranging in size from tiny buttons to carriages. They also contain more than 1,000,000 excavated objects from precontact and postcontact archaeological sites.[32] Major collection areas include Dakota and Ojibwe material culture, artifacts from the fur trade, turn-of-the-century household goods, and 20th-century manufactured and handmade items.\n\n Digital Collections\nDigital versions of collection content are increasingly being added to the Library's finding aids.\nRecent projects have resulted in digital access to criminal history files kept by the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, publications by James J. Hill, Glacier National Park and St. Paul Winter Carnival papers kept by Louis W. Hill, papers regarding Harold Stassen's WWII Pacific Fleet naval service and United Nations charter membership, and portions of Walter F. Mondale's papers. Most recently the microfilmed Dakota Conflict of 1862 Manuscripts Collection was turned into PDF files. Current digtization efforts are focused on reserve portions of select collections.\nDigital versions of Minnesota birth records and census records are only available in the library.\n\n Usage Discussion\nSuggestions for planning your research:\nVisit the library website.  It includes links to indexes of census, birth and death records as well as research tips, a guide to history topics, and the new MNopedia, an online encyclopedia about Minnesota.\nSearch the library catalog to discover publications, government records and manuscripts collections, maps, newspapers, oral histories, motion pictures, and sound recordings. \nTo dig deeper into the manuscripts and government records collections, search the finding aids.

Much of the collection is on the original nitrate film stock. The collection contains all silent newsreels and cameraman paper records from the Fox News library (1919-1930), as well as all films and paper records from Fox Movietone News in the vital early sound and war years (1928-1934, 1942-1944). \nNewsfilm Collections also contain 16mm films and documents donated by local affiliates WIS, WBTW, and WLTX. The television news materials cover significant moments in American history from 1958-1980, including the Civil Rights movement, the Vietnam War, and the moon landings. \nRegional Film Collections: \nThese remarkable collections feature amateur films by people living in the Southeastern United States, films produced by or for the University �۬of South Carolina, and films from other regional entities. The diverse collections, which include home movies, commercials, and informational films, are steadily growing. \nScience and Nature Films: \nThese include popular science films, footage produced by University of South Carolina faculty in their research, and films shot by the South Carolina Wildlife and Marine Resources Department (now the SC Department of Natural Resources). \nThe Roman Vishniac Collection is one of�۬ the gems of this collecting area. A pioneer in photomicroscopy, Vishniac�۪s scientific imaging was the basis for several classroom films, including the Living Biology series sponsored by NSF in the late 1960s. Vishniac�۪s films and photographs are beautiful aesthetic works as well as important historical documents of mid-century science education in the US. The collection also contains photographic material including negatives, prints, and slides, as well as paper records. \nChinese Film Collection: \nIn 2009, MIRC received an historic gift from the People�۪s Republic of China. One of the largest collections of Chinese-produced film held outside the PRC, it consists of more than 850 titles on 35mm and 16mm film, and more than 1,000 DVDs, including feature films, shorts, documentaries, and animation. The collection is significant as a document of cultural diplomacy after the normalization of diplomatic relations with the US in 1979.\n\n Research procedures\n Access\nAn ever-increasing number of digitized films may be seen online using the Digital Video Repository (MIRC-DVR). Personal visits to the archive can be accommodated. The general public, as well as students, faculty, and staff may view material onsite, free of charge. Visitors to the building must sign in. MIRC is open to visitors anytime during business hours, but advance notice prior to arrival is recommended. The reference library includes more than 2,000 hours of material on VHS tapes and DVDs. These materials are identified as RC#### or RD#### in our online reference catalog.\nAccess copies for materials not yet transferred can be made upon request. Although we aim to satisfy all requests within two weeks, the volume of requests and the condition of the materials may significantly lengthen our turn-around time. Technical and legal constraints may restrict access to certain collections. While the MIRC-DVR is our preferred means of providing offsite access, we are able to make customized access copies in other media for a fee.\nScholars wishing to consult the library for an extended period of time or to examine a large volume of materials should contact a curator to make arrangements.\n\n Permitted and prohibited items\n(if possible, account for laptop computers, cameras, scanners, phones, pens and pencils, loose papers, and so on)\n\nPermitted:\nProhibited:\n\n Document ordering and delivery\n(how do you request documents?  how many can you order at a time? how are documents delivered?)\n\n Photocopying, photography, microfilming\n(what are costs, permits, and page limits?  how long do you have to wait?)\n\n Key individuals\nDirector: Heather Heckman, heckmanh@mailbox.sc.edu\n\nAssistant Director and Curator, Regional Films and Chinese Film Collection: Lydia Pappas, pappasl@mailbox.sc.edu\n\nCurator, Newsfilm Collections: Greg Wilsbacher, gregw@mailbox.sc.edu\n\nCurator, Science and Nature Films: Amy Ciesielski, ciesiel@mailbox.sc.edu\n\n Practicalities\n(details on food, coffee, lockers, washrooms, transportation, internet access, and the like)\n\n See also\nMIRC posts features, events, and news on Facebook, Twitter (@UofSCMIRC) and our blog.  \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/pages/Moving-Image-Research-Collections/113678122009463 \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/UofSCMIRC \nBlog: http://library.sc.edu/blogs/mirc/\n\n\n\n"

National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) holdings include records of the judiciary, Congress, and executive agencies and commissions; federal publications; and donated historical materials. In form, the holdings consist of federal documents, manuscripts, books and bound volumes, photographs, cartographic materials, architectural drawings, still and motion pictures, video and audio recordings, and electronic records. Reference libraries containing materials related to the archival holdings are also maintained. Many of the research materials are in the Washington, D.C., area, including some agency records, not yet a part of the National Archives, that are housed at the Washington National Records Center in Suitland, Maryland. Noncurrent records created or received by the federal courts and regional offices of federal agencies are maintained in regional records services facilities located throughout the United States. In addition, NARA administers an affiliated archives program under which, through special agreements, NARA holdings are physically maintained and serviced at non-NARA institutions by non-NARA staff. There are currently seven affiliates located across the country, including the archives at the U.S. Military Academy and Yellowstone National Park. In all, NARA maintains more than 26 million cubic feet of records at all its facilities.\nSeparate depositories for the records and papers of Herbert Hoover and each subsequent president have been established as part of the presidential library system. Each library contains a president�۪s White House records and personal papers, personal papers donated by the president�۪s associates and members of his administration, state gifts, and other memorabilia of the president�۪s life and administration. Most libraries conduct oral history programs to supplement the manuscript collections. Each library also has a reference collection of books and bibliographic materials relating to the president and his administration.\n\n Regional Facilities\nAlaska\nAnchorage - NARA's Pacific Alaska Region (Anchorage)\n(Archival Research Room, Microfilm Research Room, Records Center Research Room - requires originating agency approval) \nWeb page: http://www.archives.gov/pacific-alaska/anchorage/\n\nCalifornia\nLaguna Niguel - NARA's Pacific Region (Laguna Niguel)\n(Archival Research Room, Microfilm Research Room) \nWeb page: http://www.archives.gov/pacific/laguna/\nRiverside - NARA's Pacific Region (Riverside, CA)\n(Records Center Research Room - requires originating agency approval) \nSan Francisco (San Bruno) - NARA's Pacific Region (San Francisco)\n(Archival Research Room, Microfilm Research Room, Records Center Research Room - requires originating agency approval) \nWeb page: http://www.archives.gov/pacific/san-francisco/\n\nColorado\nDenver - NARA's Rocky Mountain Region\n(Archival Research Room, Microfilm Research Room, Records Center Research Room - requires originating agency approval) \nWeb page: http://www.archives.gov/rocky-mountain/\n\nGeorgia\nAtlanta - NARA's Southeast Region\n(Archival Research Room, Microfilm Research Room, Records Center Research Room - requires originating agency approval) \nWeb page: http://www.archives.gov/southeast/\n\nIllinois\nChicago - NARA's Great Lakes Region (Chicago)\n(Archival Research Room, Microfilm Research Room, Records Center Research Room - requires originating agency approval) \nWeb page: http://www.archives.gov/great-lakes/contact/directions-il.html\n\nMassachusetts\nPittsfield - NARA's Northeast Region (Pittsfield)\n(Microfilm Research Room, Records Center Research Room - requires originating agency approval) \nWaltham - NARA's Northeast Region (Boston)\n(Archival Research Room, Microfilm Research Room, Records Center Research Room - requires originating agency approval) \nWeb page: http://www.archives.gov/northeast/boston/\n\nMissouri\nKansas City - NARA's Central Plains Region (Kansas City)\n(Archival Research Room, Microfilm Research Room, Records Center Research Room - requires originating agency approval) \nWeb page: http://www.archives.gov/central-plains/kansas-city/\nSt. Louis - National Personnel Records Center \nWeb page: http://www.archives.gov/st-louis/\n\nNew Mexico \nSanta Fe, NM - State Records Center & Archives\n(A NARA Affiliated Archives with an Archival Research Room) \n\nNew York\nNew York - NARA's Northeast Region (New York City)\n(Archival Research Room, Microfilm Research Room) \nWeb page: http://www.archives.gov/northeast/nyc/\nWest Point, NY - U.S. Military Academy Archives\n(A NARA Affiliated Archives with an Archival Research Room) \n\nOhio\nDayton - NARA's Great Lakes Region (Dayton)\n(Records Center Research Room - requires originating agency approval) \n\nOklahoma\nOklahoma City, OK - Oklahoma Historical Society\n(A NARA Affiliated Archives with an Archival Research Room) \n\nPennsylvania\nPhiladelphia - NARA's Mid Atlantic Region (Center City Philadelphia) \n(Archival Research Room, Microfilm Research Room) \nWeb page: http://www.archives.gov/midatlantic/public/\n\nTexas\nFort Worth - NARA's Southwest Region\n(Archival Research Room, Microfilm Research Room, Records Center Research Room - requires originating agency approval) \nWeb page: http://www.archives.gov/southwest/\n\nWashington (State)\nSeattle - NARA's Pacific Alaska Region (Seattle)\n(Archival Research Room, Microfilm Research Room, Records Center Research Room - requires originating agency approval) \nWeb page: http://www.archives.gov/pacific-alaska/seattle/\n\n Presidential Libraries\nHerbert Hoover Presidential Library\nFranklin D.

Lockers are in the basement, and the textual records reading room is on the second floor.  Other record reading rooms - such as photographic, film, and cartographic divisions - are on upper floors. The textual records reading room contains a few computer terminals, as well as a glassed-in room containing catalogues.  More detailed catalogues can be had in archivists' offices (2600 for the State Department) to the north of the reading room (an escort is required).  The microfilm reading room is on the third floor.  Most storerooms are on-site.\n\n Directions\nPublic transportation and driving directions can be found here.  Public transport access is functional, but less than convenient.  A free shuttle bus from the National Archives in DC can be convenient, if you are staying near downtown.\nIf you are taking the shuttle bus from the DC National Archives:\nGet off at the Archives-Navy Memorial metro stop. At the top of the metro escalator, turn left. You will see the DC National Archives straight in front of you, across the large street.\nTurn left again and head east along the large street until you get to the corner on the east side of the archives. Cross the street (heading south) so that you are on the same block as the archives building.\nThe shuttle stop will be right there, on the northeast side of the National Archives building block. It is not well marked, but if you get there close to shuttle departure time, there will be other individuals waiting.\nNote: the shuttle does not seem to have extended hours even though the College Park facility now is open until 9 pm Wednesday through Friday.\n\n Holdings\n Description of holdings\n(a more extensive description (qualitative and/or quantitative) of the holdings and the state in which they are kept)\nThat's a great question and I would love to see someone write a good answer to that. The National Archives have so much stuff that far exceeds a generalization. It's really a giant supermarket of an archive. Even if you think you've seen everything, you may find new stuff the next time you're there. Everything that had something to do with the government at some point is there - and much more.\nHowever, whatever is the topic of your research, you are bound to to find endless amount of documents about expenses and allowences. Every damn penny in the history of america is documented to the bitter end.\nThe state of the documents may also vary between the excellent and the terrible.\n\n History of the archive\nMaterials were moved to the new College Park building in the early 1990s.\nPlease also note that Archives I, the main archives building in Washington, DC, also maintains some materials - particularly legislative documents.\n\n Catalogues & finding aids\nFinding aids at the College Park archives tend to be primitive: shelf after shelf of second-generation photocopied lists, many offering only general descriptions of holdings.  It is almost always necessary to enlist an archivist or two in order to cover the bases, and many of the archivists are very helpful.  A breakdown of holdings by Record Group and size is here.  The National Archives is beginning to experiment with an online catalogue called the Archival Research Catalog (ARC).\nDespite the magnificence of the facility in College Park, the catalogue is still manual. The online catalogue that exists on the National Archives website is not a real catalogue, but a general list of the finding aids.  The finding aids themselves required a bit of learning but they are generally clear, detailed and helpful - but that's not always the case. Depending on the documents you wish to review, you may find that some of the manual catalogues are not very helpful to say the least. However, the staff of archivists is extremely helpful and they will go out of their way to help you, even when it is obvious that they are embarrassed themselves by the lacunae of the catalogues.\n\n Languages of materials\nEnglish, with some foreign languages in State Department records\n\n Restrictions & difficulties\n Classified material\n Inaccessible material\nCataloguing is inconsistent, so it can be difficult to ascertain the state of collections.  Archivists have been known to escort researchers into the stacks in order to look for obscure material.\n\n Future of the archive\n(what direction is the archive going?  what rumours have you heard?)\n\n Research procedures\n Access\nA passport or other official document will win you access, and you can register on the spot.  Be prepared for a lot of security hassles, procedures etc. Here's a list from my memory:\n1) When you enter the building you will be asked to register all your electronic equipment: computers, cameras, camcorders, tape recorders, etc.\n2) There's a whole procedure of \"familiarization\" the first time you arrive, including an issuance of a \"researcher card\". They will take your picture there, so make sure you look pretty ...\n3) You are not allowed to take inside bags, computer bags, covers for the camera, etc. Everything has to be out in the open, although you could put things in transparent bags. That's where the research carts come in handy. There are many of them roaming about in the lockers area (bring a quarter ...), and that's another reason to come early to the archives: by 10-10:30 there are no more carts and you will have to carry everything in your hands!\n4) Hold on to your researcher card, you will be asked to show it again and again, so just keep it in your pocket or something.\n5) If you're dealing with documents that were once classified you will have to go to another counter and get \"de-classified\" sticker or something. They'll tell you what to do - and someone will keep passing by your seat to check that you're doing it the right way. This is really a ridiculous procedure for purely bureaucratic reasons. The really classified stuff is not in the boxes at all, it has been pulled out and you will only find a paper that will tell you that something has been pulled out of the box. You could, however, apply to get those documents.\n6) They don't allow jackets with zippers inside nor hats. It's quite ok inside mostly, but if you suffer in an air-conditioned environment you should bring a sweater.\n\n First visit\nAfter you pass a series of security protocols, you register and receive a reader's card, with which you can enter the reading rooms.  Go to the basement to store your bags, then head in.\n\n Permitted and prohibited items\nPermitted: laptop computers, cameras, certain scanners (details)\nProhibited: ink pens and sticky notes\nAlso allowed, from observations in June: iPods\n\nYou can bring in SOME select books - namely, National Archives Publications (see the Cashier's Desk on the first floor to see what these are - they have to be appropriately stamped by the staff). You can also bring in approved outside papers - IE, if you have a piece of paper that lists the things you want to find: just take it into the first floor registration room  and they'll stamp it for you so you can take it in.\n\n Document ordering\nYou will have to fill up a form for every box you wish to review, and this is a bit of an annoying task.  When ordering documents, you must give two kinds of information.  The first kind, a description and identification number, is straightforward enough.  The second kind, description of where the material is located in the storage room, is less transparent.  This information is expressed by a series of numbers and slashes, in this form: Record Group (RG)/Row/Compartment/Shelf/Box or Volume.  \"Row\" is the name for the big sliding shelf unit in the stacks.  Each column within a Row is called a \"Compartment.\"  Each Compartment contains five or six shelves, and the workers appreciate it if you can specify the shelf number.  Then on the shelf are the boxes or volumes arranged in numeric order.  So the whole line of numbers above the ���record identification�۝ box on the order slips serves to help them get to the right shelf.  They then depend on the material in the record id.\nIn addition to that, another crucial number is the accession number that for some reason helps the archivist even more to locate your material.\n\n Ordering classified material\nYou'll have to fill out a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request for classified materials. Talk to staff members to learn mroe about this process.\n\n Document delivery\nRecords are pulled four times per day (10 and 11 a.m., 1:30 and 2:30 p.m., with a 3:30 pull Wednesday through Friday. There are NO PULLS on Saturdays); submit your orders by beforehand. Also, some collections - such as some classified materials and Nixon materials - have more limited pull times; see an archivist for details. \n\nThere is always a period of time that is wasted between one's arrival to an archive and the actual beginning of the work. Be prepared that in the National Archives this could be a few good hours. If this is your first time in the archives, even if you arrive at 9am when they open the doors, it is unlikely that you will open your first box of documents before noon, and most likely even later than that. So just plan ahead, be patient and enjoy the ride. Once you get over the \"learning curve\" things will go much more smoothly. If you're not finished with your work, they will hold your boxes out for three days, and the next time you arrive there you could start working immediately.\n\nIt takes approximately one hour (sometimes less) for documents to arrive. In the textual reading room, staff members log items as they arrive; check the notebook on the left side of the Circulation Desk (in the center of the room, near Research Assistance). Once your items have arrived, show your card to the staff members. You'll be asked to sign the pink copy of the request form, and to date, time, and initial the back.\nAll textual records materials arrive at the Circulation Desk at the center of the room, and you can have no more than one cart (24 boxes maximum) at your desk at one time. When you are finished, return the cart to Circulation. You will be asked whether you'd like those to be held or refiled.\nThe speed of document delivery depends on the amount of \"pull requests\" they have. the early \"pull\" of 10am is usually a smaller one so it could take as little as 15 minutes, but more likely it will be closer to 30 minutes. Of course, unless you've been to the archives before and know exactly what you need without looking for it in the manual finding aids you are unlikely to make it for this pull. By the afternoon the place is more crowded and the amount of requests is larger. Accordingly, you may find yourself waiting for almost an hour if not more.\nThe delivery is from a desk in the reading room itself - no running around the building (which wouldn't fly with the crazy security codes anyway ...). They deliver all the boxes in a big comfortable trolley cart - so that's not a problem at all. There is a limit on how many you can take - no more than two carts retrieved at any time (they'll keep one in the back for you). In any case, you can only work on one folder from one box every time. The rest of the box/es should stay on the cartwheel, and you need to put a sort of a giant bookmark they give you to mark the place of the folder in the box (yes! only the boxes are numbered! the folders have only names). Once in a while someone will pass behind you to check if you're doing everything according to the procedure.\n\n Photocopying, photography, microfilming\n(what are costs, permits, and page limits?  how long do you have to wait?)\nThe Archives II facility at College Park is particularly friendly to digital cameras and scanners, though you need to get a permit each day. A great many researchers have tripods at their tables, and I've been able to photograph hundreds of pages in a sitting. It's much faster and cheaper than making photocopies.\n== I second that! Bring your cameras, tripods, extra batteries and battery chargers. Every time I'm there I see a new kind of tripod that I wish I had. The best ones, I guess, are the ones in which the pole where the camera is attached can be inserted upside down into the tripod in a way that allows you to have the camera completely horizontal over the documents that you can neatly place between the legs of the tripod.\nIN ADDITION, however: some circulation staff will let you know about getting photograph/scanning permission, but not all of them will mention this. Here is the procedure:\n1. When you get your items from circulation, take them to your desk.\n2. Take ONE of the boxes to one of the two copy desks in the room. Explain that you have scanner/camera (as applicable).\n3. Staff will give you a slip to hang from your lamp, and, depending on the materials, a \"declassified\" tag that you must include in ever photo or scan for declassified materials.\n4. Return both slips of paper when you leave; get a new one each day.\nBe sure to check in for each new collection you get! Otherwise, I've seen staff make researchers delete photos from their cameras if they didn't have the proper papers.\n\n Key forms\n(what are the main forms that the archive uses? if possible, provide links to copies or post copies directly)\n\n Key individuals\n Archive staff\nIn the main research room, where you order documents, Ed is the guy who knows what he�۪s doing.\nSally Kuisel, the #2 state department archivist, is well informed.  \n\n Scholars\n(scholars who are familiar with this archive)\n\n Bibliography\n(published works based on research at this archive)\n\n Practicalities\n Food\nThe on-site cafeteria will, in concert with the security protocols, supplement the education of foreign researchers into things American.  Microwaves and vending machines also available.  The archives are rather isolated from other sources of food.\nThe place is sort of secluded and there aren't really close-by places to eat, so you'll have to rely on the cafe. Note that it is only open for lunch and close quite early (I think by 2pm). After that you'll have to rely on the vending machines or the little canteen. The cafe is quite nice; they have a large variety of choices, including a salad bar, make-your-own-sandwich bar, a grill area etc. The prices are reasonable, but if you're really short on the budget consider bringing your food with you. There's a 7-11 about 15 minutes walk from the archive, but your time is short and you don't want to waste it on 7-11 expeditions.\n\n Lockers\nLockers are in the basement. You must have a quarter with you in order to get the locker to work properly: you insert it in the door, then close the door and turn the key to lock it (you take the key with you). When you return to open the locker, you'll get your quarter back.\n\n Washrooms\n Transportation\nYou can get to the National Archives by public transportation, by shuttle bus, or by car. \nCar: If you can take your car to Archives II then - by all means - do it. They have tons of free parking there. They always say that parking is limited, but I have yet to be there on a day when there was no parking at all. In any case, here's another reason to get there early.\nShuttle bus:\nThe shuttle bus (which has been originally set up for staff) that runs between the National Archives I and II is a very convenient way to get to and from the Archives. The shuttle bus leaves the National Archives building I every hour, on the hour, and also leaves the NA II every hour, on the hour. The only problem is that the bus only runs between 9 and 5. If you are taking the shuttle bus from the DC National Archives: Get off at the Archives-Navy Memorial metro stop. At the top of the metro escalator, turn left. You will see the DC National Archives straight in front of you, across the large street. \nTurn left again and head east along the large street until you get to the corner on the east side of the archives. Cross the street (heading south) so that you are on the same block as the archives building.\nThe shuttle stop will be right there, on the northeast side of the National Archives building block. It is not well marked, but if you get there close to shuttle departure time, there will be other individuals waiting.\nThere is also a researchers only shuttle bus, which runs on Saturdays and which departs from the Prince George's Plaza Metro station every hour.  \nNote: the shuttle does not seem to have extended hours even though the College Park facility now is open until 9 pm Wednesday through Friday.\nPublic transportation:\nYou can also get to the NA II by public transportation. You can take either one of two buses, which take you to the metro. If you stay there beyond 5 pm, and if you came from DC, you will have to take public transportation back to the metro, since the shuttle bus only runs until 5 pm. The most convenient bus is the R 3, which will bring you to the green line (Greenbelt, Prince George's Plaza, or Ft. Totten). If you coordinate it well, the R 3 is very convenient and only takes 10 minutes to get from NARA II to PG Plaza. The R 3 bus stop is almost directly in front of the NARA II building, and you can get the schedule online at: (http://www.wmata.com/timetables/md/R3.pdf).\nThe other bus is the C-8, which will bring you to the red line (White Flint, Glenmont, College Park). The C 3 bus stop is down the road -- you will have to walk a bit to get there. The C8 schedule is also online at: http://www.wmata.com/timetables/md/c8.pdf\n\n Internet access\nThere's no wi-fi for researchers, but the main reading room does have some computers with Internet access, which is helpful if you need to look up something quickly. There is also a public computer with internet access in the microfilm reading room on the 4th floor.\n\n Funding\n Bookstore\nThere is a small bookstore on-site, selling certain catalogues and archive-related materials.\n\n See also\n(links to relevant websites and resources)\n\n\n\n"

You can limp by on Serbian.\n\n Directions to the archive\n Holdings\nThe Bulgarian National Archives has published several guidebooks useful in helping researchers identify relevant documents for their studies. Unfortunately, the website only contains a list of the publications and not online access to them. \n\n Research procedures\n Access\n(what permits, identity documents, or letters of reference do you need to present? how far in advance must you begin to register?)\nJust a passport and a letter outlining your research project (in Bulgarian). You can register on arrival, but it's a good idea to send them a letter (can be via email) in advance, especially if you want them to prepare material for you to view so it's ready on your arrival. They generally won't do this unless the request is for a very specific collection and with a complete archival citation (including collection, op. and a.e. numbers).\n\n Permitted and prohibited items\n(if possible, account for laptop computers, cameras, scanners, phones, pens and pencils, loose papers, and so on)\n\nPermitted: laptops (though there are a limited number of outlets in the main reading room for plugging them in), pens and pencils, loose papers\nProhibited: digital cameras except with permission and for an extremely exorbitant fee (1 lev per image as of summer '08)\n\n Document ordering and delivery\n(how do you request documents?  how many can you order at a time? how are documents delivered?) They have a database with some detailed catalogue information on some collections on a computer in the main reading room. The other inventories are in a room across the hall and can be requested there. Once you know what you want to look at, you fill out a slip with all the information and give it to the archivist. The limit previously had been something in the order of 15 a.e.'s a day, but as of the summer of 2010 this seems to have been lowered to 10 a.e.'s in use per researcher.\nSome of the documents are on microfilm and those arrive generally the same day and can be viewed on readers in a different reading room, although the age and quality of the readers mean that not all are always operational on a given day. If the material is available only in hard copy, it generally takes three days before it is available and then they bring it to the main reading room and keep it in a stack with your name on it. You can take from the stack and return material to it for as long as you need to.\n\n Photocopying, photography, microfilming\n(what are costs, permits, and page limits?  how long do you have to wait?)\nYou have to submit copy requests and they have three categories (something like normal, medium, and fast) with incrementally increasing prices. I believe the fastest turnaround is one day, otherwise it can take 3 or 4. Using a digital camera is extremely (read prohibitively) expensive at 1 lev per image (as of summer '08). Photocopies are not as expensive (I don't recall the exact prices) and they generally do a good job of organizing them and doing what you ask.\n\n Key individuals\n(give names of archive staff and other individuals who can help researchers)\n\n Practicalities\n(details on food, coffee, lockers, washrooms, transportation, internet access, and the like) There is a wonderful cafeteria on the top floor of the building with very inexpensive and tasty food for lunch and beverages (including beer) and snacks throughout the day. The view is excellent from up there and they have a balcony. Washrooms are generally without toilet paper so bring tissues.\n\n See also\n(links to relevant websites and resources)\n\n\n\n"

Significant collections in the National Bankruptcy Archives include:\nThe Lawrence P. King Papers. New York University Law School Professor Larry King served on a number of congressional commissions that were convened to analyze and reform bankruptcy law. He served in important leadership roles in the National Bankruptcy Conference, an association of bankruptcy professionals that left an indelible impact on bankruptcy law. King also edited Collier on Bankruptcy, a reference series that became the leading treatise on bankruptcy law during King�۪s 40-year tenure as Editor.\nThe Kenneth N. Klee Papers. As Associate Counsel to the House Judiciary Committee during the late 1970s, UCLA Professor Ken Klee played a crucial role in drafting what became the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978, the most dramatic revision of bankruptcy law since the 1930s. The Klee papers include drafts of bankruptcy legislation, handwritten notes, and letters from members of congress who were central to the revision of bankruptcy laws.\nThe National Bankruptcy Conference Proceedings. The National Bankruptcy Conference was perhaps the most important interest group advocating on behalf of bankruptcy reform in the 20th century. Many of its members, including Larry King, Vern Countryman, and Ken Klee, played a crucial role in shaping the Bankruptcy Code as we know it today. \nThe National Conference of Bankruptcy Judges Records. The National Conference of Bankruptcy Judges was created in 1926 to provide continuing legal education for bankruptcy judges and to advise Congress on pending bankruptcy legislation. This collection contains records that reflect the judges�۪ success in professionalizing and mobilizing the bankruptcy bench, including their efforts to gain federal judicial status.\nThe Randall J. Newsome Oral History Collection. During the 1990s, Judge Randall J. Newsome conducted oral histories with some of the most important figures in the field of bankruptcy law, including Harvard Law Professor Vern Countryman, Lawrence P. King, Asa Herzog, and George Treister. This collection includes taped oral histories and transcripts of Newsome�۪s interviews. It�۪s a great collection for anyone who wants to gain a basic understanding of the major issues surrounding bankruptcy law.\n\n Usage Discussion\nSuggestions for approaching the material:\nHousing and getting by for less in the area: \n\n\n  Fellowships and Funding Opportunities \n  Major Topic Areas \nbankruptcy, law\n\n\n\n"

During the Second World War, the Royal Canadian Navy, Canadian Army, and Royal Canadian Air Force appointed historical officers to produce reports for the future record and to form the basis of official histories. All of these reports are available for research at DHH. The most formal and comprehensive collection of reports was created by historical officers at the Canadian Military Headquarters (CMHQ) in London. The CMHQ Reports are being made available electronically over time. These reports are available only in English. Other collections include:\nBook Collection: Official histories of allied and enemy forces, general histories, campaign histories, and some technical works, as well as numerous Canadian and British regimental histories. Some bound runs of periodicals are held. There is an extensive collection of officers�۪ lists and printed regulations and administrative orders, mostly Canadian.\nKardex Collection: Papers from the Canadian Army and the Royal Canadian Air Force, mainly 1939���64, filed according to the directorate Kardex classification system. The files includes the papers of Lieutenant-Colonel H. M. Jackson, who compiled information on a number of military topics���in particular his heavily used notes on the careers of First World War Canadian officers. The Kardex Collection was closed to acquisitions in 1971.\nDocument Collection: Begun in 1971, the Document Collection is catalogued on cards, and includes all documents, reports, and narratives received between 1971 and December 1994. This collection is now closed to acquisitions.\nInMagic Databases: As of June 1995, an archival database contains descriptions of archival collections. These collections include new materials on peacekeeping.\nPermanent Reference Files: Working files of booklets, newspaper clippings, photographs, and similar ephemeral materials. Files have been created for Canadian bases in Canada and abroad, Canadian units, Canadian ships, squadrons of the Royal Canadian Air Force and Canadian Forces, and aircraft types, both Canadian and foreign.\nBiographical Files: Open working files for many Canadian servicemen and civilians, of all ranks and professions, and for some selected foreigners. The biographical files are supplemented by card files of Second World War honors and awards, casualties, prisoners of war, etc., for Canadian personnel. There is also a card file of Canadians who served in the British flying services in the First World War.\nSteiger Materials: The late Mr. Steiger�۪s collection of documents in the German language which originated in Germany during the Second World War. Many are translated into English. They also include documents relating to research on specific aspects of the First World War, lists of documents held in other archives, and some secondary published material about German military history in general. \nPublic Record Office and Related Materials: Large quantities of Public Record Office documents photocopied in London for research on the Royal Canadian Air Force and Royal Canadian Navy histories. \nNaval Historian�۪s Collection: Large collection of naval materials arranged by the old Royal Canadian Navy file number and catalogued in a separate Kardex.\nPhotograph Collections: Several collections of photographic prints are available. Captions to Royal Canadian Air Force Second World War public relations photographs are held in the document area; prints and negatives for these are held by the National Archives of Canada. A similar collection of Second World War Army public relations photographs may be located through the Kardex catalog. The directorate does not hold photographic negatives. As a rule recent negatives are held by the Canadian Forces Photographic Unit. Those more than 15 years old are in the Documentary Art and Photography Division, National Archives of Canada.\n\n\n Usage Discussion\nSuggestions for approaching the material:\nHousing and getting by for less in the area: \n\n Categories\n\n\n"

Born in Kentucky, raised in Iowa���a move necessitated by her father�۪s lack of success in business���and denied a college education after a stellar performance in high school���again due to her family�۪s financial difficulties as well as her poor health (chronic asthma and periodic bouts of bronchitis and pneumonia)���Harrison devoted much of her early adulthood to caring for her younger siblings, nieces and nephews.\nIn its early years, the kindergarten movement in the United States was guided by the philosophy and practice developed by the German Friedrich Froebel (1782-1852) in the 1830s. Froebel�۪s Kindergarten��Ӊ��Childrens Garden�۝���merged the private (home) and public (school) worlds in an environment that would educate both children and their mothers through purposeful play with ���gifts�۝ (cloth balls, wooden blocks, etc.) and application of ���occupations�۝ (writing, drawing, painting, working with clay, etc.). Ironically, the first American kindergarten was begun in Wisconsin by a German immigrant, Margarethe Schurz, in 1855, four years after kindergartens were banned in Germany. As interpreted by his early adherents in the United States, Froebel�۪s educational philosophy emphasized the special qualifications of women, especially mothers, to be kindergarten teachers.\nThe kindergarten, initially, was conceived as autonomous, separate from the public school system and, thus, free from supervision by men. Marriage and motherhood, in fact, were an advantage in early childhood education, not the hindrance they were perceived to be (by men) to the effectiveness of (female) public school teachers. During the 19th Century, the view of early childhood education in the United States was transformed from that of necessary moral and religious discipline by parents to the nurturing of individuals�۪ qualities by professional educators. By the end of the century the kindergarten movement was at the center of debates over this ���New Education.�۝\nIt was into this educational ferment that the 30-year-old Elizabeth Harrison stepped in 1879. At the urging of a childhood friend, Harrison visited Chicago and enrolled in the Kindergarten Training School run by Alice H. Putnam, who opened the first (private) Kindergarten in Chicago in 1874, and in nine months Harrison received both a diploma and a certificate to train kindergarten teachers. In the following few years, Harrison attended Susan Blow�۪s Kindergarten School in St. Louis, the first public school kindergarten in the country (opened in 1873), and traveled to New York to study with Maria Boelte���who had lived and studied with the widow of Froebel���and with John Kraus, both of whom had also taught Susan Blow and Alice Putnam. Thus, within a few years of her introduction to the kindergarten, Harrison had studied with the pioneers of the movement in the United States.\nUpon her return to Chicago in 1883, Harrison cultivated her potential audience of teachers and mothers by organizing (with Alice Putnam) the Chicago Kindergarten Club, and three years later opened Miss Harrison�۪s Training Class for young teachers and mothers, which attracted more than 700 students. It is to this Training Class that National-Louis University traces its origins.\nWhen Harrison arrived in Chicago in 1879, there were a handful of kindergartens in the city, either private or affiliated with churches. In 1887, when Harrison opened the Chicago Kindergarten Training School, there were nearly 50 kindergartens (private, church, settlement house, and the first one in a public school) in the Chicago area. Five years later, in 1893, that number had again doubled, with Harrison�۪s students supervising instruction in half of them. Her partner was Mrs. John N. (Rumah) Crouse, wife of a prominent Chicago dentist, who managed the school�۪s finances, publicity, student recruitment, facilities and fund raising. Especially after Harrison�۪s 1890 visit to the Schrader Training School in Germany, directed by a niece of Froebel, where Harrison observed a regimented and repetitive application of Froebel�۪s principles, she and Crouse expanded the curriculum to include such social and cultural subjects as the sciences, literature, art, music, sociology and psychology.\nReflecting this broad curricular program, the Kindergarten Club and the Training School sponsored annual Literary Schools, focusing on historical literary figures (followed in later years by a series of Psychology Schools focusing on topics of contemporary interest in the field of psychology), and the local press spread word of Harrison�۪s activities to a broader audience.\nIn 1891, the Chicago Kindergarten Training School reorganized as the Chicago Kindergarten College, with the added requirement of a high school education for admission, and the following year it added a one-year postgraduate course. In subsequent years the School reorganized and changed its name several times: in 1906 it incorporated as a non-profit institution with a board of directors; in 1912, it affiliated with the National Kindergarten Association and became the National Kindergarten College; in 1917, it became the National Kindergarten and Elementary College, accredited to award bachelor�۪s degrees, which it remained until 1930, when the school adopted a four-year undergraduate curriculum and its name was changed to National College of Education. In 1990, with the articulation of separate Colleges of Arts & Sciences and Management & Business, in addition to the National College of Education, the name was changed to National-Louis University.\nHarrison also was a founding member of the International Kindergarten Union in 1892 and remained an influential member until her death in 1927. As the IKU evolved, Harrison assumed leadership of the ���moderate�۝ faction, situated between the ���Conservative�۝ adherents of a strict Froebelian method, represented by Susan Blow, and the younger ���Liberals,�۝ who allied themselves with the educational philosophy of John Dewey.\nThe World�۪s Columbian Exposition of 1893 in Chicago featured a kindergarten exhibition much expanded over that at the 1876 Centennial Exposition at Philadelphia, including a demonstration kindergarten and other programs overseen by Harrison�۪s Training School and Kindergarten Club. The School also began publishing the Kindergarten Magazine, which contributed to Harrison's growing international reputation.\nIn 1894, Harrison convened the first national Mothers�۪ Convention (forerunner of the PTA), which drew 1,200 attendees to Chicago. By 1900, there were more than 5,000 public school kindergartens in the United States and more than 200 kindergarten training schools. By the beginning of the 20th Century, Chicago Kindergarten College alumnae were represented on the faculty of Normal schools around the country, which were beginning to take the idea of the kindergarten seriously. Largely through Harrison�۪s efforts, the kindergarten became more widely viewed as a legitimate contribution to early childhood education rather than merely a form of child�۪s play, day care for the children of the wealthy or immigrants and the poor. At the same time, Harrison never lost sight of the social reform potential of childhood education, since many kindergartens were located in settlement houses and other institution that served immigrants and other underprivileged members of the population.\nIn 1912 Harrison visited Rome to observe Maria Montessori�۪s school, and, after publication of her report in 1914 by the U.S. Bureau of Education, the College began to offer courses in Montessori�۪s method. Further, a Demonstration School for kindergarten and elementary school students opened in 1917-18 under the supervision of Clara Belle Baker (1885-1961), the sister of Edna Dean Baker (1883-1956), a 1913 graduate of the College and Harrison�۪s chosen successor. In 1920, following a heart attack, Harrison resigned the presidency of the College and was succeeded by Edna Baker. She spent the remaining years of her life in the southern United States until her death in San Antonio Texas, in 1927. The author of some 20 books on childhood and education, Harrison worked on her autobiography, Sketches Along Life�۪s Road, until her death, but it was published only posthumously in 1930.\n\n Research procedures\n Access\n(what permits, identity documents, or letters of reference do you need to present? how far in advance must you begin to register?)\n\n Permitted and prohibited items\n(if possible, account for laptop computers, cameras, scanners, phones, pens and pencils, loose papers, and so on)\n\nPermitted:\nProhibited:\n\n Document ordering and delivery\n(how do you request documents?  how many can you order at a time? how are documents delivered?)\n\n Photocopying, photography, microfilming\n(what are costs, permits, and page limits?  how long do you have to wait?)\n\n Key individuals\nMark Burnette, Archives and Special Collections Librarian\n\n Practicalities\n(details on food, coffee, lockers, washrooms, transportation, internet access, and the like)\n\n See also\n(links to relevant websites and resources)\n\n\n\n"

In 1881 the librarians began to collect and edit for publication the naval records of the Civil War. That portion of the library�۪s staff engaged in this work soon became known as the Naval War Records Office and, collectively with the library, was designated the Office of Naval Records and Library. After a series of organizational changes, including the addition of historical writing, museum, and curatorial functions, the Navy�۪s central historical organization became known in 1952 as the Naval History Division. In 1971 the organization was redesignated the Naval Historical Center.\nThe Navy Art Collection Branch manages more than 10,000 works of art and arranges changing displays in the gallery and traveling exhibits. The collection is a unique visual record of America�۪s involvement in a variety of missions worldwide.\nThe center�۪s Aviation History Branch, a component of the Naval Warfare Division, maintains aviation command historical records covering 1957 to the present with limited documentation covering the entire history of naval aviation beginning in 1911. The branch also manages the Naval Aviation Insignia Program and the archives for the insignia covering World War II to the present.\nThe center�۪s Contemporary History Branch, a component of the Histories and Archives Division, was established in 1987 to prepare comprehensive historical works treating the history of the U.S. Navy in the 20th century. Branch historians research and write major narrative volumes on fleet operations, naval-industrial relations, Navy interaction with other defense organizations, and women in the service. They prepare shorter specialized studies and edit existing manuscripts for publication.\nThe Curator Branch performs curatorial functions for most Navy-owned historical properties. Its holdings of museum objects, including paintings and prints, number over 115,000. The curator�۪s Photographic Section holds more than 250,000 still photographs, which span the entire period of U.S. naval history. Its collections are the principal American pictorial resource on naval history through World War I and provide a valuable supplement to the holdings of the National Archives and Department of Defense Still Media Records Center for subsequent years. Limited research services can be provided by the staff, and facilities are maintained for visiting researchers.\nThe Early History Branch, a component of the Histories and Archives Division, provides a broad historical research, writing, and editing capability, particularly in 18th-, 19th-, and early 20th-century naval history. It holds an extensive collection of microfilm records, including newspapers, plus photocopies of naval and maritime documents gathered from public archives, libraries, historical societies, and private collections in this country and abroad. A limited number of outside researchers can be accommodated.\nThe Navy Department Library contains 175,000 volumes with a concentration on naval history, biography and autobiography, exploration, and naval science and technology. The library is very rich in naval periodicals, many of which exist in long series. Special collections include approximately 5,000 rare books dating from the 15th through the 20th centuries. In addition, the library has a collection of graduate theses and dissertations in naval history and a valuable group of approximately 300 unpublished administrative histories of major World War II naval commands. The administrative histories are available in microform for interlibrary loan.\nThe Navy Museum houses the Navy�۪s general historical museum. Located in the Breech Mechanism Shop of the old Naval Gun Factory, the museum contains over 40,000 square feet of display space and more than 5,000 objects. A two-acre outdoor park contains large artifacts such as Civil War ordnance and modern missile batteries. Museum displays depict the history of the Navy from the American Revolution to the Space Age, as well as special topics such as polar exploration, naval electronics, oceanography, customs and traditions in the Navy, and the life of the sailor. Highlights include a submarine room with operating periscopes, a fighting top and replica gun deck from USS Constitution, a World War II Corsair fighter, and the bathyscaphe Trieste. On the Washington waterfront the decommissioned postwar destroyer Barry (DD-933) is open for public tours.\nThe Operational Archives, a component of the Histories and Archives Division, maintains a select group of manuscripts, records, historical documents, and personal papers related to naval history in the 20th and 21st centuries and undertakes historical research in these collections. The bulk of the branch�۪s holdings date from 1945 and relate to naval operations, policy and strategy, the history of specific commands, officer biographies, and oral histories.\nThe Ships�۪ Histories Branch, a component of the Naval Warfare Division, maintains over 14,000 files, containing historical reports, press clippings, and correspondence, that document, in whole or in part, the careers of most of the ships commissioned in the Navy from the American Revolution to the present time. Special collections include files detailing the naming of naval ships since World War I and the designation of their sponsors. The section has reference files on historic ship memorials and nautical museums, bibliographies of published works on the history and evolution of naval ships, and on other naval and nautical subjects of general interest. The branch also has charge of naval ships�۪ logs from 1945 to the present. Since most of these must be recalled from storage for use, researchers should make arrangements in advance. The branch also has charge of naval ships logs that are less than 30 years old.\nThe Underwater Archaeology Branch advises the Navy in matters related to historic preservation of U.S. Navy ship and aircraft wrecks. An underwater archaeologist oversees and coordinates this program that deals not only with archaeology and conservation, but many sensitive issues such as war graves, unexploded ordnance, potential use of recovered weapons systems, and complicated legal issues dealing with title and the illegal removal of property from wrecks.\nThe senior historian is also chief, Histories and Archives Division. In that capacity he supervises the research, writing, and production of official histories and is the primary contact for scholars wanting to use the center�۪s facilities for extensive research. The senior historian manages the center�۪s grant, fellowship, scholarship, and oral history programs.\nThe Naval Historical Foundation has offices with the Naval Historical Center. It is an unofficial, nonprofit organization, chartered in Washington, D.C., in 1926, whose main objectives are to collect and preserve private documents, papers, and artifacts of naval historical significance. Important collections are placed on deposit in the Manuscript Division of the Library of Congress, where they are cataloged and indexed for the use of interested researchers. The foundation collection now contains over 300,000 items in more than 250 separate collections. Those wishing more information may write to the Executive Director, Naval Historical Foundation, Bldg. 57, Washington Navy Yard, 805 Kidder Breese St., SE, Washington, DC 20374���0571.\n\n\n Usage Discussion\nSuggestions for approaching the material:\nHousing and getting by for less in the area:\n\n\n\n"

Eccles Library of the Naval War College, located in Hewitt Hall, houses a collection of about 500,000 items. The collection is particularly strong in subjects of interest to the naval profession: naval and military science, history and strategy, management, economics, international law, international relations, oceanography, and contemporary world issues. The college�۪s archives and manuscript collection is a part of the Eccles Library but is located in Mahan Hall.\nThe concepts of the college�۪s founders, as well as the evolutionary development of the administration and the curricular programs of the Naval War College, are documented in over 1,200 linear feet of Naval Historical Collection archival records. Holdings include administrative correspondence and memorandums, staff studies, reports and surveys, student theses, papers, faculty and guest lectures, college publications, intelligence and technical research source collections, conference records, and photographs. The materials are divided into record groups, all of which have been inventoried.\nManuscript holdings of the Naval Historical Collection consist of more than 250 collections of personal papers and corporate naval records, and over 600 single manuscript items. Significant naval warfare collections include the papers of former college presidents Stephen B. Luce, Alfred Thayer Mahan, Charles H. Stockton, William Veazie Pratt, Raymond Ames Spruance, and Richard G. Colbert. Regional collections include historical files of the Newport Naval Training Station, the Newport Naval Base, the Quonset Naval Air Station, and the Naval Torpedo Station, formerly on Goat Island in Newport�۪s inner harbor. All collections have been cataloged and inventoried and a number of collection registers have been printed and are available on the college�۪s web site.\nOral histories, newspapers, pamphlets, and naval history subject files constitute other categories of materials available in the Naval Historical Collection.\nThe Naval War College Museum is one of the U.S. Navy�۪s 12 official historical museums and is part of the system of museums that is managed under the director of naval history at the Naval Historical Center, Washington, D.C. The Naval War College Museum is located in Founders Hall, a National Historic Landmark. The building was where the college began in 1884 and where the second president and lecturer on naval strategy, Captain Alfred Thayer Mahan, delivered his famous lecture series on The Influence of Sea Power Upon History, 1660���1783, first published in 1890. In addition, the museum maintains a loan exhibit to nearby Fort Adams State Park.\nThe museum collects and preserves materials relating to the history of the art and science of naval warfare and the naval heritage of the Narragansett Bay, and makes use of these materials for educational exhibitions and associated programs. Generally speaking, museum exhibitions seek to identify the milestones in the evolutionary development of war at sea; explain the importance of the sea as a factor in the formulation and achievement of national policy objectives and as the arena wherein decisions are made through diplomacy and arms; and describe the eventful relationship of the U.S. Navy with Narragansett Bay and with the people of Rhode Island from the birth of the nation to recent times.\nThe museum serves as the corporate memory of the navy in the region and of the college, as well as a clearinghouse for information on U.S. Navy history for the interested public and scholars in the southern New England area. The museum collection is open to study by graduate students and specialists. The museum director, a subjects area specialist, counsels researchers, delivers talks, and publishes articles in newspapers, magazines, and scholarly journals.\nThe main listing of materials in the Naval Historical Collection is\n\n A Guide to Archives, Manuscripts and Oral Histories in the Naval Historical Collection\".\n\nIn addition, there are two additional subject guides:\n\n A Guide to Research Source Materials on Women in the Naval Historical Collection\n\n A Guide to Research Source Materials on Latin America and the Caribbean in the Naval Historical Collection\n\nAnd the following registers of collections of the papers of individuals:\n\n  Anderson, Bern, RADM    \n  Baruch, Barnard M., Jr., CAPT  \n  Bates, Richard W, RADM  \n  Belknap, George E., RADM & Belknap, Reginald R., RADM   \n  Burgess, W.

      "Archive_Info": "The Asian/Pacific American Documentary Heritage Archives Survey is the first systematic attempt to map available and potential Asian/Pacific American archival collections in the New York metropolitan area. The project seeks to address the under-representation of East Coast Asian America in historic scholarship and archives by working with community-based organizations and individuals to survey their records and raise awareness within the community about the importance of documenting and preserving their histories. The website, by digitally bringing together descriptions of the often fragmentary and scattered documentary heritage of the New York Asian/Pacific American community, hopes to serve as a central resource for information about these surveyed hidden collections.\nThe project, initiated in September 2008, is a collaboration between the New York University Tamiment Library & Robert F. Wagner Archives and the Asian/Pacific/American Institute and is funded by a one-year grant from the Metropolitan New York Library Council. The first year of survey work (2008-2009) has been conducted by three NYU graduate students, Hillel Arnold, I-Ting Emily Chu, and Yung Hua Nancy Ng Tam. The second year of surveys (2009-2010) has been conducted by Yung Hua Nancy Ng Tam and Amita Manghnani.\n\n\nContents\n\n1 Website:\n2 Holdings\n\n2.1 Access\n\n\n3 Related Links\n\n\n  Website: \nhttp://dlibdev.nyu.edu/tamimentapa/\n\n\n\n Holdings\nThe website currently holds information on nearly eighty collections documenting the Asian/Pacific American experience in New York and the East Coast and continues to grow as new surveys of organizations and individuals are completed. The collections described on the website are located in the homes of artists, activists, scholars and businesspeople; the offices of social service organizations, advocacy groups, theater companies, labor unions and arts organizations; and archival repositories in the New York City metropolitan area. Documentation constitute forms as varied as videotapes, photographs, emails, newspaper clippings, letters and artwork. Survey participants include the Asian American Arts Centre (AAAC), Asian CineVision, Asian/Pacific/American Institute at New York University, Arkipelago, Japanese American Association of New York (JAA), Ma-Yi Theatre Company, New York Taxi Workers Alliance, Coalition for Asian American Children and Families (CACF), Nodutdol for Korean Community Development, Soh Daiko and many others.

However, the special collections housed within this library have different hours; you should realy go to their web-site and check the specific section you are interested in at http://www.nypl.org/hours/index.cfm?Trg=3&loc=124. For example, the special collections reading room does not open until 1 pm.\nE-mail Reference\nThe New York Public Library for the Performing Arts answers ready reference questions via e-mail.\nBilly Rose Theatre Collection:  theatrediv@nypl.org\nThe Circulating (lending) Collections:  lpacirc@nypl.org\nJerome Robbins Dance Division:  dance@nypl.org\nMusic Division:  E-mail form\nRodgers and Hammerstein Archives of Recorded Sound:  rha@nypl.org\nTheatre on Film and Tape Archive:  toft@nypl.org\n\n Working language(s)\n(Main working language is English)\n\n Directions to the archive\nLocated at Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, at Columbus Circle in NYC. This is a subway stop in mid-town.\n\n Holdings\nPlease see above for a brief description. This is a HUGE archive and cannot be summarized here. However, much of it is on line. The entire dance collection, for example, is searchable through the NY Public Library catalogue, and much (although not all) of the other divisions' materials are also searchable on line. There are specific reference librarians for each of the divisions (eg, dance, music, theatre, recorded sound). The catalogue can be searched here: http://catnyp.nypl.org/\n\n Research procedures\n Access\nYou do have to register to use the collections, but this can be done on-site. I had my passport with me, and not even sure I needed to show it for ID. Not a difficult procedure, in other words. And if I remember, there is no charge. You are issued an 'access' card, which is good for any library in the system.\n\n Permitted and prohibited items\n(if possible, account for laptop computers, cameras, scanners, phones, pens and pencils, loose papers, and so on)\n\nPermitted: laptop computers; cameras in the general reading room, but not in the special collections room; pencils only.\nProhibited: you can't bring your whole bag in, but there is a staffed cloakroom right there. I brought in: laptop, power cord, camera, folder with a few pieces of paper.\n\n Document ordering and delivery\nThere is a staffed desk, where you turn in call slips--up to six at a time. Most of the material is on-site, and when it is available (usually within the hour), your desk number is lit up on a board. You walk up, and they give you the materials OR, if they are to be consulted in the special collections reading room, you go there. You can keep materials on hold overnight if you don't get through them all. \nPlease note that some materials are off-site. You can order them up before your arrival and have them delivered to this, or any, NYPL. I did this and had no trouble retrieving the materials on my arrival.\n\n Photocopying, photography, microfilming\nThere are photocopy machines there, and staff members who photocopy fragile materials for you, eg from special collections. If the material is not fragile in the opinion of the reference librarian, you can do it yourself at the self-service machine. I forget the cost, but it seemed reasonable--certainly under 25cents per page. The staff was very helpful and did the work right away; I did not have to wait until the next day, for example. Computers: no problem; can use in all locations. Camera: I was able to make copy images in the general reading room, but not in the special collections reading room (although someone else was using a camera, actually--maybe depends on how familiar you are). They have a whole set up for ordering images from the collections. There is a cloakroom, which is staffed at no charge, where you can store coat and bags.\n\n Key individuals\nEach area of the collections has specific reference librarians. See above, or their site, for further details.\n\n Practicalities\nAt the library, right outside the reading room, are washrooms and a cloakroom. I wasn't able to find decent food in Lincoln Centre itself when I was there, but Alice Tully Hall was also under renovation. However, the library is right at Columbus Circle, and there's plenty to get there: starbucks, cafes, etc. There's more on the front side of the building than the rear. A nearby hotel with a really good promotional price is one of the Thompson hotels, 6 Columbus Circle. Lincoln Centre is also right on the subway line.\nAs for internet: the library is wireless, so I had no problem getting on line from my computer at the desk I was occupying.\n\n See also\n\n\n"

Please check all bags and coats at the coat check on the library's first floor.\n\n Hours and Usage Restrictions\nTuesday & Wednesday: 11 am to 7:30 pm,  \nThursday, Friday & Saturday: 11 to 6 pm, \nClosed Sundays & Mondays.\n\n  Online Catalogs and Finding Aids \nFinding materials in the Manuscripts and Archives Division is a multi-step process. While our website provides some access to our collections, using all of the discovery tools described below will help ensure that you do not overlook an important source for your research.\nThe Collection Descriptions and Guides page http://www.nypl.org/research/chss/spe/rbk/collect.cfm provides access to nearly 1300 collection-level catalog records and over 250 finding aids. These two types of descriptions can be searched simultaneously. This page also offers the options of searching only the collection names or browsing an alphabetical list of collections.\nWhile powerful, these searches yield results that are by no means complete for several reasons: many of our collections are described only in the paper guides described below; finding aids do not always lend themselves to fruitful keyword searching; and, while Manuscripts and Archives holds more than half of all the archival material in the Research Libraries, there are substantial archival resources in other divisions.\nSurvey and Miscellaneous Files\nResearchers wishing to locate letters and other documents of a specific person should also consult the survey files. http://www.nypl.org/research/chss/spe/rbk/surveys.cfm These surveys are arranged alphabetically and list all of the materials (which we happen to have located) by a specific individual throughout our collections. The surveys are not comprehensive ���they are meant to serve as a time-saving device so that the same collections need not be searched numerous times for the same material. Researchers are encouraged to search other collections that may prove fruitful for their research as the survey files have not been rigorously updated in recent years.\nMiscellaneous Files\nUncataloged materials arranged by subject, geographic location, and personal name can be found in the Miscellaneous Files. http://www.nypl.org/research/chss/spe/rbk/faids/misc/browse.cfm The contents of these files can range from a single clipping in a personal name file to several boxes of documents relating to the history of New York. Readers may consult three loose-leaf notebooks containing a list of personal names files. There are also files for each of the fifty states and several nations.\nCATNYP\nSearch CATNYP http://catnyp.nypl.org/ to find collection-level descriptions of most of the large manuscript collections in the Manuscripts and Archives Division. Note that CATNYP searches can be limited by \"material type\" to retrieve only archival materials.\nCATNYP should be used in conjunction with the Division�۪s card catalog. The card catalog of the Manuscripts and Archives Division is the most comprehensive guide to materials acquired through 1985. It is alphabetically arranged and contains entries for names, subjects, geographic locations and types of documents (diaries, account books, logbooks, maps, literary typescripts, etc.). Descriptions of collections acquired after 1985 can be found in CATNYP.\nPrinted Works\nThe two-volume Dictionary Catalog of the Manuscript Division, (Boston: G.K. Hall, 1967) reproduces the card catalog of manuscript collections as it appeared in 1966. Although it is no longer comprehensive, this important guide to our collections is available in research libraries throughout the world.\nOnce a reader discovers particular collections of interest, s/he should consult the inventory of that collection if one exists. The inventory contains a more detailed description of the collection and includes a container list that provides a box by box breakdown of the collection's contents. Occasionally, the inventory will include a list of correspondents represented in the collection or an index to the contents. There are inventories for most major collections available in the reading room. A growing selection of collection inventories may be consulted on the Division�۪s web site.\nPublished Guides\nIn some cases, a published guide can be consulted in lieu of an inventory. Published guides to our manuscript collections include the Calendar of the Emmet Collection of Manuscripts etc. Relating to American History (New York: The New York Public Library, 1959); Colonial Latin American Manuscripts in the Rich Collection by Edwin Blake Brownrigg (New York: The New York Public Library, 1978), Guide to the Budke Collection by John H. Bennett (Nyack: Benlind, 1975), Report on American Manuscripts in the Royal Institution of Great Britain (London: Royal Commission on Historical Manuscripts, 1904-1909), Catalogue of Cuneiform Tablets of the Wilberforce Eames Babylonian Collection by A. Leo Oppenheim (New Haven: American Oriental Society, 1948), and Islamic Manuscripts in the New York Public Library by Barbara Schmitz (New York: Oxford University Press, 1992).\nSurveys\n\n Collection Summary\nThe Manuscripts and Archives Division holds approximately 29,000 linear feet of archival material in over 3,000 collections, dating from the third millennium BCE to the current decade. Manuscript collections contain original materials regardless of format, including not only paper documents, but photographs, sound recordings, films, videotapes, artifacts and electronic records.\nThe greatest strengths of the Manuscripts and Archives Division, however, are the papers of individuals, families, and organizations, primarily from the New York region, dating from the 18th through the 20th centuries. Particularly important collections on the American Revolution and early U.S. history are the Chalmers, Bancroft, Livingston, Schuyler, Emmet, Myers and Gansevoort-Lansing collections, and, for early colonial Latin American history, the Obadiah Rich Collection. Civil War history is particularly well documented in the extensive records of the United States Sanitary Commission.\nNotable collections pertaining to literature include the papers of Washington Irving, H.L. Mencken, Genevieve Taggard, Carl Van Vechten, Edgar Lee Masters, Babette Deutsch and Truman Capote, as well as numerous letters and manuscripts by such writers as William Cullen Bryant, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Herman Melville, James Joyce and Ezra Pound in other collections. Publishers' archives include the records of the Century Company, Crowell-Collier, Macmillan, Alfred A. Knopf, Inc., Farrar, Straus & Giroux, Inc., and The New Yorker.\n\n Usage Discussion\nPending public perspectives\n\n  Fellowships and Funding Opportunities \n  Major Topic Areas \nPolitical, economic and social history collections include the papers of Norman Thomas, Fiorello H. LaGuardia, Robert Moses, Lillian Wald, Rose Pesotta, Frank Walsh, Fannia Cohn and Vito Marcantonio, and the records of the Emigrant Savings Bank, The Emergency Committee In Aid of Displaced Foreign Scholars, the National Civic Federation, the Committee of Fifteen, the Committee of Fourteen, the International Gay Information Center, the New York Central Railroad, CARE, the National Audubon Society, and the New York World's Fairs of 1939/1940 and 1964/1965.\nDocuments relating to the history of The Library and its predecessor institutions can be found in The New York Public Library Archives. Archives holdings include early records of The Library, as well as those of the Astor Library, Lenox Library and Tilden Trust whose resources were combined to form The New York Public Library in 1895.\nThe Manuscripts and Archives Division is one of several units of the Research Libraries holding original materials. Similar collections are located at The Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture (Manuscripts, Archives and Rare Books Division and Moving Image and Recorded Sound Division) and The New York Public Library for the Performing Arts (Dance, Theatre, and Music Divisions, and Rodgers & Hammerstein Archives of Recorded Sound). The Berg Collection contains vast holdings of literary manuscripts and authors' correspondence. The Spencer Collection includes numerous illuminated manuscripts. Photographs received as part of manuscript and archival collections remain with those collections, but significant related photographs may often be located in the Photography Collection and the U.S. History, Local History and Genealogy Division. The Manuscripts and Archives Division does not collect facsimiles, microfilms of collections in other repositories, or most printed works about manuscript collections in other libraries; most of these are located in the General Research Division.\n\n\n\n"

With more than 1,500,000 volumes, 5,000,000 manuscript pages, and 500,000 historic maps, its strong general collection embraces history and the humanities in Europe and the Americas, from the late Middle Ages to the early 20th century. \nThe Newberry Library�۪s manuscript collections focus on the library�۪s areas of collecting strength: the Renaissance; European history and literature; American history and literature; the history and culture of Chicago and the Midwest; printing, calligraphy, and book arts; the colonization of the Americas and contact with American Indians and Indigenous populations; maps, travel, and exploration; and the westward movement. The Newberry has about 260 pre-1500 manuscript codices, several dozen individual documents and charters, and hundreds of fragments. Complementing exceptional printed and single manuscript resources for early modern Europe are family archives, diplomatic documents, and a collection of literary manuscripts. The Edward E. Ayer Collection includes manuscript materials relating to the settlement of the Americas and contacts with Indigenous populations into the 20th century. Closely related, the Everett D. Graff Collection focuses on the exploration, settlement, and development of the country west of the Mississippi. The John M. Wing Foundation on the History of Printing is home to a number of personal papers and business archives documenting all aspects of calligraphy, printing, and design. The library�۪s extensive Midwest Manuscript Collection, dating from settlement to the present, is also particularly strong in the areas of literature, music, dance, the arts, journalism, social action, politics, the Civil War, the family, women, business, and clubs and organizations. Of particular note are the records of three important American railroad companies headquartered in Chicago: the Illinois Central Railroad, the Chicago, Burlington & Quincy Railroad, and the Pullman Company. Supporting excellent genealogy and family history collections are manuscript collections of American families of all economic and ethnic backgrounds who settled in Chicago and the Midwest. Many of the manuscript and archival collections contain photographs dating from the late 1840s and extensive bodies of ephemera--printed programs, brochures, pamphlets, posters, etc. \n\n Usage Discussion\nSuggestions for approaching the material: For more information, please consult the Newberry Library website (www.newberry.org) for descriptions of the library�۪s areas of collecting strength and abstracts of over 800 individual American modern manuscript collections. \nHousing and getting by for less in the area:\n\n\n\n"

The library is open weekdays 9am - 5pm, Saturdays 9am - 1pm, and Sundays 1pm- 5pm. More information on hours and closures can be found on Wilson Library's Hours webpage.\nRetrieval:\nWilson Library is a closed-stack library. Staff members will retrieve library materials for patrons. Researchers need to register online and present a current form of government-issued, photographic identification in order to request materials from the stacks. All library materials are currently stored on-site and can be quickly retrieved. However, North Carolina Collection materials are occasionally inaccessible when on exhibit or loan, or when receiving conservation treatment. Users planning a visit in order to use specific materials should consult with the North Carolina Collection reference staff (wilsonlibrary@unc.edu) in order to ensure that the materials they need will be available.\nLockers:\nBags - including backpacks, purses, and laptop cases - are not allowed in the North Carolina Collection reading room. Free lockers are provided for researchers to check their bags. Food, drink, and all tobacco products are also prohibited in the reading room.\nCirculation:\nSome North Carolina Collection materials can be checked out. These items will be listed as \"Available\" in the UNC library catalog. UNC students, faculty, and staff can check out circulating materials with a current OneCard. Researchers not affiliated with UNC may be able to obtain a library borrower's card. Please see the Davis Library Circulation page for more information.\nPhotocopies:\nThe North Carolina Collection permits photocopying, digital photography, and scanning of most collection materials. Please see the North Carolina Collection's  Photocopies, Photography, and Scans page for more information about their equipment and policies.\nPhotographic Archives:\nThe North Carolina Collection seeks to promote education and an appreciation for the value of historical photographs through public use of images held by the Collection. Access to the Photographic Archives is provided to all researchers on an equal basis. Pictorial research and image use is subject to the following general guidelines. The North Carolina Collection, however, reserves the right to make exceptions or additions to any of the terms stated herein on a case-by-case basis.\nGallery:\nThe Gallery exhibitions are free and open to the general public. Visitors may either browse on their own or arrange for guided tours with staff. Teachers who are interested in providing their classes with multi-disciplined field trips should consider UNC-Chapel Hill's campus. Situated within a short walking distance of one another are the Ackland Art Museum, Morehead Planetarium, and the North Carolina Collection Gallery. Thus, a \"research triangle\" of art, science, and social-history experiences and tours can be arranged between these three institutions. It should be noted, too, that the Gallery's facilities are also available to the university community as a meeting area for smaller seminars, classes, and other special programs. \nDirections & Parking:\nFor directions and information on parking and disability access, see the North Carolina Collection's Directions & Parking page.\n\n  Online Catalogs and Finding Aids \nOnline Catalog\nMost (about 90%) of the holdings of the North Carolina Collection are cataloged in the UNC Library's online catalog. This catalog includes records from all of the libraries within the University Library system at UNC-Chapel Hill. Researchers looking only for materials in the North Carolina Collection can limit their searches to the North Carolina Collection.\nBiographical Index\nThe North Carolina Collection Biographical Index is an index of names compiled from over 500 books and journals containing biographical information on North Carolinians. Includes citations.\nClipping Files\nFor more than a half-century North Carolina Collection staff members have compiled and indexed articles from North Carolina newspapers. The clippings are bound and available for use in the NCC reading room. Indexes to most of the clippings are available on the Newspaper Clippings page on this website.\nResearch Guides\nResearch guides prepared by North Carolina Collection staff members and UNC-Chapel Hill students provide handy starting points for research topics including Textile Mills, UNC History, and North Carolina during the Revolutionary War.\nOnline Exhibits\nMany of the online exhibits on this site contain materials from the North Carolina Collection. These exhibits are often good starting places for research projects, and many contain images of and references to important primary source materials.\n\n Collection Summary\nThe North Carolina Collection preserves an assemblage of literary, visual, and artifactual materials illustrating four centuries of the colony and state of North Carolina. More than 120,000 books and 78,000 pamphlets form the core of the North Carolina Collection, but these formats are supplemented by newspapers, journals, maps, broadsides, photographs, audiovisuals, microforms, and other materials. Tracing its origins to the founding of the North Carolina Historical Society in 1844, the North Carolina Collection has grown to become the largest collection of printed materials related to a single state.\nPhotographic Archives:\nToday the photographic holdings total an estimated 1.5 million images that include examples of all major formats from the daguerreotype of the 1840s to the contemporary. The photographs are historically descriptive and documentary in nature. They provide a visual record of North Carolina's people, places, and events. Files exist for all 100 of the state's counties. The Photographic Archives is also the major repository for historical images documenting the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.\nThe Gallery:\nThe North Carolina Collection Gallery presents a variety of exhibitions that feature literature, photographs, and artifacts from the North Carolina Collection's extensive holdings, and is responsible for overseeing more than 22,000 museum objects.\n\n Usage Discussion\nSuggestions for approaching the material:\nHousing and getting by for less in the area: \n\n  Fellowships and Funding Opportunities \nNone at present.\n\n  Major Topic Areas \nThe NCC holdings are especially strong in printed materials relating to the history and culture of North Carolina, from the earliest accounts of explorers along the North American coast to present-day books and journals. There are extensive holdings of newspapers and maps in the NCC and an unparalleled collection of North Carolina literary works.\n\n\n\n"

The University Archives serves as the repository for both non-current official University records and a wide variety of other material including the papers of individual faculty members, the records of student organizations, holdings which pertain to individual students and alumni, photographs, and artifacts.  The University Archives' holdings are open for research and reference use and are non-circulating.\nThe collection includes an array of over 1,300 separate University-generated serial publications, from newsletters of student organizations to official departmental reports to catalogs and bulletins from each of Northwestern�۪s schools and colleges.  Of particular research value are complete runs of the Daily Northwestern, the school newspaper, and the Syllabus, the student yearbook.  \nThe University Archives also contains a vast collection of over 10,000 files of biographical materials relating to Northwestern faculty, staff, alumni, and others associated with the University.  The department also contains a considerable volume of material relating to campus culture including a collection of approximately 600,000 photographs documenting all manner of school activities.  Student diaries, scrapbooks, and curricular materials are well represented.  The University Archives holds thousands of motion picture films, videotapes, and audio recordings of Northwestern events.\nSome of the notable bodies of official University records and manuscripts held by the University Archives include the papers of celebrated anthropologist Melville J. Herskovits (1895-1963), and renowned Chicago pediatrician Isaac A. Abt (1867-1955).  Observational and administrative records of the Dearborn Observatory are valuable sources relating to the history of science.  The papers of Foster G. McGaw (1897-1986) reflect the life of a noted philanthropist.  Corporate records of McGaw�۪s business, the American Hospital Supply Corporation, also are held by the University Archives.\nCourt records addressing the well-known Leopold and Loeb trial of 1924 are found in the papers of psychiatrist Harold S. Hulbert (1887-1949).  Other matters at law are documented through the files and correspondence of Seventh Circuit United States Court of Appeals Judge Robert A. Sprecher (1917-1982), of Chicago Municipal Court Chief Justice Harry Olson (1867-1935), and lawyer Nathan W. MacChesney (1878-1954) as well as through the papers of Northwestern School of Law faculty Fred Inbau (1909-1998), Nathaniel Nathanson (1908-1983), and John H. Wigmore (1863-1943).

      "Archive_Info": "The Ohio Historical Society (OHS) was chartered in 1885 for the purpose of preserving significant materials of the state�۪s past and encouraging an understanding of history, archaeology, and natural history. Today, the Ohio Historical Society conducts an expanded range of activities related to interpretation, collection, and preservation of Ohio�۪s history. During the past century, the society has collected more than two million items related to the state�۪s heritage. With over 9,000 members, OHS is one of the largest state historical organizations in the country.\nA private, nonprofit organization, the society serves as the state�۪s agent in historical matters in return for a subsidy that constitutes, typically, about two-thirds of the operating budget. Other financial resources arise from gifts, grants, admissions, and sales revenues. As a service to the state of Ohio, OHS offers varied educational services for teachers and students; manages the state archives; administers the state�۪s historic preservation office; provides resource services to other historical organizations in the state; and operates a network of historical sites and museums, which attracts nearly half a million visitors annually. Nine trustees appointed by the governor represent the state�۪s interests in OHS activities. The other members of the society�۪s 21-member board of trustees include nine representatives elected by the membership and three appointed by the board.\n\nContents\n\n1 Address and Contact Info\n2 Hours and usage restrictions\n3 Collection Summary\n4 Usage Discussion\n\n\n Address and Contact Info\nAddress: 1982 Velma Ave., Columbus, OH 43211-2497\nPhone: (614) 297-2300\nFax: (614) 297-2411\nE-mail: webmaster@ohiohistory.org\nWeb page: http://www.ohiohistory.org\nExecutive Director and CEO:  William K.

The collections are comprised of 142,000 volumes of books; more than 15,000 maps; 85,000 rolls of microfilm; 12,000 sheets of microfiche; 10,700 cubic feet of manuscript material; and 8,500 cubic feet of audiovisual material, including 1 million photographic images. Included in the library holdings are documents from the settlement of the Northwest Territory, extensive Civil War papers, and correspondence. The society houses the largest collection of early and modern Ohio newspapers in existence. The collection is comprised of 4,500 titles, 20,000 volumes, and 49,979 rolls of microfilm. As the State Archives of Ohio, the society collects, maintains, and provides access to 13,500 cubic feet of local government records and 20,000 cubic feet of state archives. Digital exhibits and online databases such as the African American Experience in Ohio, Beyond the Call of Duty, Fight for the Colors, Ohio Memory Online Scrapbook, OhioPix, and the Online Death Index allow collection access to more than 1,000,000 visitors a year. \nThe archives/library presents a variety of workshops throughout the year to historical and genealogical organizations. Individual researchers have the opportunity to attend workshops designed to introduce family history researchers to the extensive amount of records and resources available. The state archives participates in the state�۪s records management program, assists local governments with records management issues, and provides leadership and guidance in developing solutions for preservation of government records in electronic formats.\nThe Ohio Historical Society�۪s museum collections represent a broad range of natural, cultural, social, political, and industrial materials from prehistoric times to the present. In total, its three-dimensional objects number just under 2,000,000 items. The collections consist of over 1,000,000 archeological items, primarily prehistoric American Indian cultures in Ohio. Of these, the collections relating to the Hopewell, Adena, and Fort Ancient cultures are particularly strong. The history collections feature a broad range of objects that document life in Ohio from the first settlement of the Northwest Territories to the present, and contain approximately 250,000 items. These collections are strong in ceramics, glass, textiles, firearms, and Ohio aviation history. The natural history collections consist of over 350,000 specimens and are outstanding in Ohio fossils, skeletal collections, insects, and minerals.\n\n Usage Discussion\nSuggestions for approaching the material:\nHousing and getting by for less in the area:\n\n\n\n"

The full-text of current issues of the Journal of American History (June, 1999 to present) is available electronically to members of the OAH and to subscribing institutions at The History Cooperative [[2]].\n\n Usage Discussion\nThe records of the Organization of American Historians are extensive and provide an in-depth look at the history and evolution of the organization. Although records such as board minutes and conference proceedings have small gaps, they provide the best overview of the organization because of their continuity. The collection is also evidence of the growth of the organization from a small, one-person office to an office environment employing several individuals.\n\n  Fellowships and Funding Opportunities \n  Major Topic Areas \nExecutive Board Records, 1907-1998, consist of minutes, reports, administrative records, a newsletter, committees, past president files, legal information, and correspondence all dealing with the organization's executive board. This series is divided into five areas: Minutes, Administration, Correspondence, Committee Records, and Past President Files. The minutes are the best resource for obtaining a broad overview of the organization. Although incomplete, the board minutes include the earliest meeting and run through 1995. The least amount of documentation is available during the 1920s-1940s, but some information about decisions made affecting the organization during this period is located in the journal, Mississippi Valley Historical Review.\nThe Administration Files contain the articles of incorporation, constitution, bylaws, and executive secretary reports to the board. A brief newsletter, the Board Bulletin, 1991-1996, kept board members informed about OAH Executive Office activities. Board correspondence includes the writings of individual board members and the executive director discussing major activies and future directions of the organization.\nThe Committee Files are the largest portion of the records in this series. Information about the members, goals, and activities of most of the OAH committees can be found here. They are divided into three sections: awards, service, and joint committees with other organizations. These records contain correspondence, reports, and minutes from the various committees of the organization and indicate the long-term goals and projects of OAH. More information about specific projects are located in the subject files of the Executive Director records. Although information about the Membership Committee is located in this series, information about individual members and membership lists are maintained by the office of the treasurer and are located in the Treasurer Files.\nPast president Files contain mostly biographical information. Included are histories, brief overviews, and correspondence.\nExecutive Office and Executive Director Files, 1906-2000, is the largest segment of the OAH records. These records best reflect the growth of the organization. They are produced by the main administrative office of the organization and document most of its activities. This series is divided into two areas: Executive Office and Executive Director.\nThe Executive Office Files contain correspondence and subject files. There are two distinct sets of correspondence. The alphabethical correspondence covers the years 1906-1995 and is arranged by year and then the person with whom the director is corresponding. Between 1906 and 1953, the organization maintained a staff of one (the director) and the correspondence for these years is the only record of the activities of the executive office. This correspondence reflects all of the roles the director fulfilled in the office as well as their own personal correspondence with individuals and organizations. After 1953 the organization and its staff expanded. Between 1953 and 1969, James Olson and William Aeschbacher each served as director. While the alphabetical correspondence continues to document the activities in the executive office, the directors maintain there own personal records located in the Executive Director Files of this series. Following 1969 as the organization continued to undergo major administrative change, the alphabetical correspondence remains a source for information about the activities of the executive office, but programs and further information about occurances during a director's tenure may be found in the subject files. The daily correspondence files cover the years 1984-1999 and overlap some with the alphabetical correspondence. It is arranged chronologically by the date sent or received. Although the information within these files do not duplicate the alphabetical files, they represent different filing systems. To fully understand the years contained in the files both sets of correspondence files as well as the subject files should be consulted. The final and largest set of records in this area is the subject files. As the organization grew, it became more involved in new programs, added personnel, and became politically active. The subject files cover this wide range of activities and represent the program side of the organization from the mid-1970s to 2000. Three executive directors' tenures are represented by this set of records: Richard Kirkendall, Joan Hoff-Wilson, and Arnita Jones.\nThe second area this series covers is the Executive Director Files. These files include the correspondence files of three executive directors: James Olson, William Aeschbacher, and Thomas Clark. These files contain correspondence with specific individuals about program activities and is an excellent resource to understand each directors' goals and programs. To receive a more complete view of the happenings in the organization during these directors' tenures, the alphabetical correspondence should also be consulted.\nTreasurer Files, 1907-1998, contain audits, correspondence, budgets, membership information, and reports from the office of the treasurer of the OAH. The two major reports in this series are the membership and treasurer reports. Much of this information is incomplete, but can be used with the executive board minutes to construct an accurate picture of the organization's financial status throughout its history. The membership information includes the card files and membership lists used to track member names, addresses, and years in the organization. This series also includes the financial ledgers maintained by the treasurer that indicated the names of both individual and institutional members and the amount paid during a particular year. The member cards and ledgers only cover the period of the beginning of the organization through the early 1960s, the period of the combined Secretary-Treasurer postion. This series also contains the correspondence of individual treasurers that includes information about their role as treasurer and involvement in committee work.\nAnnual Conference Programs, 1910-1911, 1913-1914, 1916-1917, 1921-1925, 1927, 1929, 1932-1936, 1938-1944, 1947-1948, 1950-1989, 1991-1993, 1997, contain an incomplete set of the programs and business meeting minutes from the annual OAH conference. More information about the annual conference is located in the Journal of American History records as published proceedings that include papers presented and meeting minutes.\nPublications Files, 1908-1999, consist of the materials related to the various publication projects of OAH. These include the OAH Newsletter, Journal of American History (JAH), the OAH Magazine of History, and other publications produced either by the executive or editorial offices of the organization. The records are divided into two areas: materials published by the executive office and those published by the editorial office. Included in the executive office publications are the OAH Newsletter and the OAH Magazine of History. The files contain correspondence regarding the publication of these resources and incomplete sets of both the magazine and newsletter as well as executive office correspondence regarding the publication of the Journal of American History. This correspondence helps indicate the relationship between the executive office and the editorial office where the Journal is actually produced.\nThe main portion of records in this series come from the editorial office and include the records of the Journal of American History, editorial board minutes, correspondence, awards, reports, editor files, accepted and rejected manuscripts and copies of the journal. The main administrative functions of this office are covered in the editorial board, awards, and correspondence files. They contain a good overview of the office's activities and in the instance of the correspondence files, 1930-1992, cover a vast time period and document the evolution of the Journal. The editorial office publishes the Journal of American History, the scholarly journal of OAH. Within the Journal records are a complete set of print copies and an incomplete set of microfilm copies of the publication. The journal is also available online through JSTOR, 1914-1999, (http://www.jstor.org/cgi-bin/jstor/listjournal/) and the History Cooperative, 1999-present, (http://www.historycooperative.org/jahindex.html). The records also contain both the accepted and rejected manuscript files of the journal. The accepted manuscripts include copies of the earliest version of the article (if available), peer reviews, and correspondence related to reviews. Rejected manuscript files include peer reviews and correspondence related to those reviews. The policy of the editorial office is to return declined manuscripts and there are few instances of the files containing a copy of them. The OAH archives do not include complete manuscript files prior to 1950 or the last five years of material. Access to the manuscript files is governed by a restriction policy (see above).\nPhotograph Files, 1907-1997, contain photographs of the presidents, executive secretaries, treasurers, secretary-treasurers, chairmen of the board, and editors of OAH. The photographs are arranged alphabetical by the individual's name.\n\n\n\n"

Yonge Library of Florida History is located on the second floor of George A. Smathers Library (Library East) on the campus of the University of Florida.  It is part of Special Collections.  \n\n Holdings\nThe Yonge Library specializes in collecting books, manuscripts, brochures, images, and maps basic to research on the history of the state of Florida and its people.  It is especially noted for its holdings, on microfilm, of Spanish and British colonial records. The majority of published works on colonial Florida have been researched, in part, at the Yonge Library.  Its collections are also strong in the Seminole Wars, the American Civil War, Florida politics, natural and environmental sciences, travel accounts, and Florida fiction.  The 10,000 piece tourism brochure collection covers the entire state, with pieces from the 1870s to the present.  The Historic Florida Map Collection is the most extensive at a public institution and includes both original maps and photocopies of maps from other institutions.  Much of the newspaper collection is now available on microfilm from the Main Library at the University of Florida or online at the Florida Digital Newspaper Library; the Yonge Library continues to curate paper copies of 19th century Florida newspapers.\n\n Research procedures\nResearch is open to the public during operating hours.  University of Florida students and faculty have access to computers, scanners, and photocopiers through their university IDs.  Other researchers can get temporary ID cards for computer access(no charge, apply at main desk in the Grand Reading Room).  Photocopying requires use of a copy card with a $15 minimum balance (good throughout the library system).\n\n Access\nVisitors are asked to check in at the main desk of the Grand Reading Room and to fill out the registration form.  \n\n Permitted and prohibited items\nThe Grand Reading Room follows the standard procedures of rare book and manuscript rooms in terms of what can be brought in.

Requests for loans should go to the InterLibrary Loan Department at the Smathers Library (http://illiad.uflib.ufl.edu/illiad/)  \n\n Photocopying, photography, microfilming\nResearchers are allowed to photocopy, scan, and take pictures of items; however, please check with the desk monitor before copying any material.  Fragile and rare items should not be copied.  All materials should be returned to the main desk in good condition and manuscript papers should be kept in the order in which they were found.  Materials can be placed on hold for extended research. \n\n Key individuals\nThe curator for the P.K. Yonge Library is Dr. James G. Cusick.  Archivists and other personnel of Special Collections are listed here: http://www.uflib.ufl.edu/spec/scstaff2.html\n\n Practicalities\nThere is a coffee shop in the main library next door to Special Collections and other restaurants and coffee shops nearby.  The George A. Smathers Library has handicap accessible washrooms on the first, second, and third floors, and elevator access to all floors.  The main stair case is temporarily inaccessible in Summer 2010 for refurbishing.  University of Florida campus is accessible on Gainesville bus routes.

PAHRC's collection includes records that document the history of the Archdiocese of Philadelphia as well as the collections of the American Catholic Historical Society of Philadelphia, the oldest Catholic historical society in the country.  The bulk of materials from the latter collection, specifically printed materials including newspapers, journals, and pamphlets published in the United States,  span the mid 19th to the early 20th century. Archdiocesan records include the sacramental registers (baptismal and marriage records) of those parishes located within the present Archdiocese since their founding. PAHRC provides researchers with various services including historical research assistance, genealogical research, an excellent reference library, and photoduplication of approved research materials.\n\nContents\n\n1 Address and Contact Info\n2 Hours and Usage Restrictions\n3 Collection Summary\n4 Usage Discussion\n5 Major Topic Areas\n\n\n Address and Contact Info\nAddress: 100 E.

Casino\n\n Hours and Usage Restrictions\nThe center is open Monday through Friday from 9:00-4 pm. \nAccess to American Catholic Historical Society collections is practically unlimited and major portions of the Seminary and Archdiocesan materials are open to researchers. Access restrictions to Seminary and Archdiocesan records apply to all unpublished materials after 1920; however, these materials may be opened to researchers with special permission.\n\n Collection Summary\nThe Philadelphia Archdiocesan Historical Research Center collects printed materials, manuscript collections, and audiovisual materials relating to the history of the Archdiocese of Philadelphia. These materials include the records of numerous Archdiocesan offices, the official correspondence of all of the bishops and archbishops of Philadelphia up to the present, as well as records from the 41st International Eucharistic Congress held in Philadelphia in 1976 and Pope John Paul II�۪s visit in October 1979. Archdiocesan records also include the sacramental registers of those parishes located within the present Archdiocese since their founding.\nPAHRC also houses the collections of the American Catholic Historical Society of Philadelphia, as well as some records from St. Charles Borromeo Seminary. ACHS records include printed, visual, and ephemeral materials that document institutions, associations, societies, religious orders, and parishes located within the Archdiocese as well as those of other dioceses located in the Mid-Atlantic region. The ACHS collection also includes 19th and 20th- century Catholic newspapers, journals, and pamphlets published throughout the United States, as well as the manuscripts of prominent Catholic clergy and laity. Other published materials in the collection include catechisms, devotional works, liturgical books, and sacred music.\nPAHRC�۪s image collection contains photographs and other visual materials documenting Catholic clergy, laity, and institutions of the Archdiocese. Two notable collections include the Packard and Butler lithograph collection as well as the Robert and Theresa Halvey Photograph Collection. The latter collection includes 100,000 photographs (including negatives) that Robert Halvey took for the Catholic Standard & Times, the official Archdiocesan newspaper, from 1935 to 1999 as well as photographs for Catholic institutions that Halvey took as a freelance photographer.\nThe Museum is largely comprised of Catholic artifacts, and includes the Cardinal Krol Memorabilia collection and the Museum of Religious Americana. The latter collection contains about 400 items of Catholic, Protestant, and Jewish origin. \nIn order to support study of the collections, PAHRC maintains a library with both reference and research materials, including Archdiocesan and National Catholic directories, Philadelphia City directories, and encyclopedias. Secondary sources include scholarship relating to the history of Catholicism in the United States as well as social and cultural histories of the various ethnicities that shaped the American Catholic Church.\n\n Usage Discussion\nSuggestions for approaching the material:\nHousing and getting by for less in the area: \n\n  Major Topic Areas \n\n\n"

The library is supported by donations.\nThe Pritzker Military Museum & Library has strong collection holdings relating to the American Civil War, especially regimental histories of units from the Midwest; the Spanish American War; and World War II, especially the Pacific Theatre, prisoners of war (both theatres), and memoirs from participating veterans.

Littrell, retired military figures such as Gen. Anthony Zinni and NASA Capt. Jim Lovell, as well as authors such as Doris Kearns Goodwin and W.E.B. Griffin. Programs are webcast live on the library's website and archived for later viewing or listening in streaming media or as podcasts. The programs are downloaded at a rate of 2,000 per month per program. They are also broadcast on Chicago PBS affiliate WYCC Channel 20 (as Pritzker Military Presents) and on Chicago PBS affiliate WTTW Channel 11 (as Citizen Soldier). \nIt has also hosted exhibitions by artists such as Steve Mumford, William Foley, and members of the Midwest Air Force Association. Current exhibits are based on the library's own holdings.  To see entries on the Library's current gallery exhibits, see: http://www.pritzkermilitary.org/explore/museum/permanent-current-upcoming-exhibits/. \nThe Library's 2006 event schedule was named an Official Honoree of the 2007 Webby Awards.

Staff members will retrieve library materials for patrons. Researchers need to register online and present a current form of government-issued, photographic identification in order to request materials from the stacks. All library materials are currently stored on-site and can be quickly retrieved.

Today, the collection includes over 160,000 printed volumes, as well as substantial holdings of original graphics, medieval and Renaissance manuscripts, and literary and historical papers.\nThe RBC's diverse materials sustain the study of such varied topics as the New World cronistas, English and Irish literature, French history, fine printing, Spanish and Catalan drama, World Wars I and II, the Beat movement, the Russian Diaspora, Mayan archaeology, the Greek and Latin classics, as well as American popular culture.\n\n Usage Discussion\nSuggestions for approaching the material:\nHousing and getting by for less in the area: \n\n  Fellowships and Funding Opportunities \nNone at present.\n\n  Major Topic Areas \nThe NCC holdings are especially strong in printed materials relating to the history and culture of North Carolina, from the earliest accounts of explorers along the North American coast to present-day books and journals. There are extensive holdings of newspapers and maps in the NCC and an unparalleled collection of North Carolina literary works.\n\n\n\n"

Upon arrival outside researchers must present a photo identification and fill out form stating the nature of their research. A readers' card will then be issued. This process takes approximately fifteen minutes. Researchers must present this card on all subsequent visits. It is suggested for visiting researchers to call at least one day ahead of their visit to make sure their desired materials will be available for use. \nRequesting documents is best done prior to a research visit via email or telephone. (See above for contact info) Be sure to state the collection name and specific items you are interested in. The items will be set aside for your use, and will be delivered to and removed from the reading room for you as needed. Only one document may be viewed at a time.\nFor more information see here: http://rarebooks.library.nd.edu/using/access.shtml\n\n Permitted and prohibited items\nPermitted: Laptops, cell phones (the official Reading Room Policies states that cell phones are prohibited, but this is not enforced), pencils, notebook\nProhibited: Loose clothing items, pens, food and drink, cameras, backpacks and purses, umbrellas\n\n Photocopying and Imaging Services\nPhotocopying is available for printed materials, given that the state of item will allow it. The cost is $.10 per page smaller than 11\" X 17\", and $.15 per page larger than 11\" X 17\".\nFor manuscript materials, items larger than 12\" X 17\" will be photographed, while those smaller will be scanned. For Notre Dame faculty, staff, and students, each scanned image costs $5 and each photograph costs $10. The general public will pay $10 per scanned image and $15 per photograph. There is normally a 2-4 week waiting period for manuscript images.\nFor more information on the duplication policy see here: http://rarebooks.library.nd.edu/using/duplication.shtml\n\n Practicalities\nFood & Coffee: Many meal options can be found in the LaFortune Student Center a short walk (less than five minutes) away from the Hesburgh Library. There is a Subway, Pizza Hut, Burger King, Taco Bell, and Starbucks there. If you prefer to remain inside the library to dine, there is an Au Bon Pain caf̩ with coffee, soup, sandwiches, and various baked goods just down the hall from the reading room.\nLockers: The Department of Rare Books and Special Collections has many lockers available for researchers in its coat room. They are big enough to store a backpack comfortably.\nRestrooms: There is one single-stall restroom immediately outside of the reading room. However, if you wish for a larger restroom, they are available near the circulation desk inside the library.\nParking: For parking and shuttle services, see here: https://library.nd.edu/help/visitors.shtml#simple2\nWork Environment: The Rare Book and Special Collection's reading room has both pros and cons in regards to its work environment. On the one hand, large windows allow for lots of natural light. Also, the presence of only four work stations means that the reading room in never crowded. On the other hand, students are almost constantly walking past the windows, which may make it hard to focus. Also, the Department of Rare Books and Special Collections often hosts exhibits and displays that attract lots of people, making for a noisy environment at times.\n\n\n\n"

Russell Library for Political Research and Studies is a department within the University of Georgia Libraries that reports to the University Librarian and serves as a center for research and study of the modern American political system. Established in 1974 through the efforts of the Richard B. Russell Foundation, Inc., the Georgia General Assembly, and the University System of Georgia Board of Regents, the Library�۪s original mission was to collect and preserve materials that document the life and career of the late Richard B. Russell, United States Senator from Georgia from 1933 to 1971. With particular emphasis on the role of Georgia and the U. S. Congress, current collection development and programming focus on the dynamic relationship of politics, policy, and culture���generated wherever public interest intersects with government. The breadth and depth of Russell Library�۪s collections provide an interconnected framework of perspectives and experiences for understanding the increasingly diverse people, events, and ideas shaping Georgia�۪s political landscape.\n\nThe Russell Library pursues alliances and opportunities for collaboration with individuals and organizations that advance its mission. The Library is a founding member of the Association of Centers for the Study of Congress and a primary partner and official repository for the Foot Soldier Project for Civil Rights Studies, a collaborative project dedicated to documenting and chronicling the activity and perceptions of lesser known participants in the civil rights movement in Georgia. The Russell Library is also dedicated to developing and presenting public programming and educational materials that facilitate and encourage research, raise public awareness of the Library and its collections and services, and provide learning opportunities for the communities it serves.\n\n Contact Information\nRichard B.

To determine where specific materials are located (Yorba Linda vs. College Park), visit the Nixon Library website. When you search under \"Textual Materials,\" the website specifies location of each set of files.\nFor materials at College Park, finding aids with box numbers are in the Civilian Records side of the Research Assistance Room in the second-floor research room. Use the finding aids to determine which boxes you will need (there may be discrepancies between the box contents listed on the Nixon Library website versus what is listed in the finding aids at College Park).\nSubmit Nixon Library material requests to the CIRCULATION DESK at Archives II (usually, researchers submit requests to staff in the Research Assistance Room, but Nixon Library requests go directly to staff at the Circulation Desk instead). Nixon materials are pulled at the same times as all other materials.\nRequests for Nixon Library materials at College Park are far more simple to fill out than typical requests. For example, materials from the White House Central Files would simply need your name, researcher number, date, and this information in the large field:\nNixon Presidential Library\nWhite House Central Files - Subject Files\nFG13, Box 1\n(where \"FG13\" equals whatever subject file code you need, and insert the proper box number for that specific code).\nFor additional information on getting around Archives II at College Park, please visit that page of the ArchivesWiki site.\n\n Usage Discussion\nSuggestions for approaching the material:\nHousing and getting by for less in the area:\n\n\n\n"

      "Archive_Info": "The Rockefeller Archive Center was established in 1974 to preserve, maintain, and encourage research in the archives of the Rockefeller family, The Rockefeller University, the Rockefeller Foundation, and the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, as well as in the records of associated organizations and individuals. The center has a staff of 30 professional and support personnel.\n\nContents\n\n1 Address and Contact Info\n2 Hours and usage restrictions\n3 Collection Summary\n4 Usage Discussion\n\n\n Address and Contact Info\nAddress:  Rockefeller Archive Center, 15 Dayton Avenue,  \nSleepy Hollow, NY 10591\nPhone: (914) 631-4505\nFax: (914) 631-6017\nE-mail: archive@rockarch.org\nWeb page: http://www.rockarch.org/\nPresident: Jack Meyers\nVice President and Director, Research and Education Department: James Allen Smith \nOnline Finding Aid: A searchable database that lists open, processed material is accessible from the Search Our Collections feature on the Archive Center website \nArchivists (principal contacts for advice on the collection):  Refer to the list of staff members on the website\n\n Hours and usage restrictions\nThe Reading Room is open from 9:00 AM until 5:15 PM on weekdays, and on a more limited schedule one Saturday each month.  See the website for the schedule and for holiday closings.  NOTE: The Reading Room is small, with seats for only seven researchers at a time, so RESERVATIONS are required to conduct research. Researchers should contact the Archive Center to schedule an appointment before making travel arrangements. \nThe use of digital cameras is not permitted in the Reading Room, nor is there self-service photocopying. A researcher can request photocopies (maximim of 2,000 copies per year), but RAC staff will make the copies and mail them to the researcher after the visit.  Copies are $0.40 per page for the first 1,000 copies, $0.55 per page for copies 1,001 to 2,000.\n\n Collection Summary\nEstablished in 1974 and opened in 1975, the Archive Center brought together under one roof the existing archives of its founders: the Rockefeller family, the Rockefeller University,  the Rockefeller Foundation, and the Rockefeller Brothers Fund. The addition of the records of other institutions, such as the Social Science Research Council, the Commonwealth Fund, and the Russell Sage Foundation, and the papers of individuals associated with Rockefeller-funded endeavors, has since expanded the scope of the center�۪s holdings, which now total 70 million pages of documents, 500,000 photographic images, and 4,000 films. A description of the center�۪s holdings and programs is available through its web site.\nThe Rockefeller family archives includes the correspondence and personal financial records of John D. Rockefeller (1839���1937); correspondence and project files of John D. Rockefeller, John D. Rockefeller Jr. and his sons and associates in the Office of the Messrs. Rockefeller (1890���1961); the correspondence and diaries of John D. Rockefeller 3rd (1906���78); a microfilm collection of the political files of Winthrop Rockefeller (1912���73); and the correspondence, diaries, and financial records of William Rockefeller (1841���1922). The papers of Laurance S. Rockefeller (1910-2004) and the papers of Nelson A. Rockefeller (1908-1979) are now being processed.  More than 2,300 cubic feet of Nelson A. Rockefeller's papers are now available for research, along with more than 135,000 photographs. The material documents major portions of his public service career; his philanthropic, business, and civic activities; and his collection of art. \nThe Rockefeller Foundation, established in 1913, has conducted worldwide programs in agricultural development, the arts, education, humanities, medicine, natural science, public health, and the social sciences, and public health. Its archives include grant files, program and policy files, officers' diaries, general correspondence, and financial records. Files older than 20 years are open for use.\nThe Rockefeller University, organized in 1901 as the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research, was the first American institution devoted solely to medical research. Its archives include reports to the Board of Scientific Directors, administrative correspondence, business manager�۪s files, and photographs. The Archive Center also holds the personal papers of former faculty members and administrators. \nThe Rockefeller Brothers Fund, organized in 1940, has been interested in cultural advancement, education, health, religion, welfare, international relations, conservation, population control, and racial equality. Its archives include correspondence, reports, grant files, and Special Studies Project files. \nThe Archive Center also holds the records of numerous other Rockefeller-funded philanthropies, such as the General Education Board, 1902���60; the China Medical Board of New York, 1914���73; the Laura Spelman Rockefeller Memorial, 1918���41; the International Basic Economy Corporation, 1945���77; and the Winthrop Rockefeller Foundation. It also contains the records of the Commonwealth Fund, 1918���2000; the Russell Sage Foundation, 1888���1982; the John and Mary R. Markle Foundation, 1935���79; the Charles E. Culpeper Foundation, 1886���1991; the Social Science Research Council, 1924���90; the Foundation for Child Development, 1899���1990; the Foundation Center; the Trilateral Commission (North America), and the Downtown-Lower Manhattan Association.  The Archive Center also recently acquired the records of the Near East Foundation.\n\n Usage Discussion\nSuggestions for approaching the material:\nAccess to most of the Center's collections is most often through the names of institutions or individuals who received support from or had contact with a collection's creators.  A searchable database is available online at the website, but it includes only processed, open collections, and provides references only to names that appear in folder titles or available folder descriptions.  In addition to using this database, researchers also should submit queries to the Archive Center staff at archive@rockarch.org; staff also have access to more detailed card indexes that are not available online.  See also the subject surveys that are available online under Publications.\nHousing and getting by for less in the area:\nSee the Information for Researchers feature of the RAC website for a list of local accommodations and information about the RAC's limited shuttle service between the RAC and the Metro North  train station in Tarrytown.  \nThe Archive Center also has a competitive research Grant-in-Aid program that provides support for transportation and lodging costs associated with research visits.  Details and application materials are available from the RAC website.\n\n\n\n"

While there is no fee to conduct research, there are charges of 20 cents per copy for self-service photocopying and 75 cents per copy if copied by the Reagan Library staff. Audiovisual materials can also be reproduced for additional fees. Researchers are not required to make an appointment or reservation to use the research room.  However, the library highly recommends that researchers contact them prior to their first visit so the library can confirm open material for a specific topic is available. All requests for material should also be requested before 3:30 p.m.\nResearchers are also invited to visit the Ronald Reagan Presidential Museum which is open from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.\n\n Collection Summary\nAs a Presidential library administered by the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), the Reagan Library, under the authority of the Presidential Records Act, is the repository of presidential records for President Reagan�۪s administration. Its holdings include 50 million pages of presidential documents, over 1.6 million photographs, a half million feet of motion picture film and tens of thousands of audio and video tapes.  Additionally, the Library houses personal papers collections including documents from Reagan�۪s eight years as governor of California.\nThe Federation of American Scientists has posted online all the declassified National Security Decision Directives from the Reagan years.\nThe National Security Archive at the George Washington University has also posted online many documents from the Reagan years.  \nThe website, www.thereaganfiles.com has also posted many of the recently declassified National Security Council and National Security Planning Group meeting minutes from the Reagan years.\n\n Usage Discussion\nSuggestions for approaching the material:\nThe material at the Reagan Library is generally categorized into either White House Staff and Office Files (WHSOF) and White House Office of Records Management Subject Files (WHORM). In many cases, the same document is located in both the WHSOF's and the WHORM subject files. \nThe WHSOFs are organized by person or office and are mostly compiled from the material that person or office left in their office after leaving their White House position. For example, their is a WHSOF for Office of Speechwriting, as well as a WHSOF for a particular speechwriter, like Anthony Dolan and Peggy Noonan. \nIn contrast, the WHORM files were compiled by the WHORM which organized the records by subject. For example, Judicial Appointments is located within the FG WHORM subject guide.\nIn response to the numerous Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests the Reagan Library has received over the years, the Reagan Library staff has compiled a FOIA topic guide organized by subject of the FOIA. The FOIA topic guide is extremely useful to researchers because the FOIA topic guide is a list of where material is located relevant to a particular subject and references both the WHSOF's and the WHORM subject files.  \nHousing and getting by for less in the area:\nSimi Valley offers a number of hotel options. A short drive away, Thousand Oaks and Westlake, a 20 mintute drive from the Reagan Library,  offer further hotel options.\n\n\n\n"

SFC holdings extensively document all forms of southern musical and oral traditions across the entire spectrum of individual and community expressive arts, as well as mainstream media production.\nCentered around the John Edwards Memorial Collection, the SFC is especially rich in materials documenting the emergence of old-time, country-western, hillbilly, bluegrass, blues, gospel, Cajun and zydeco musics. There is also extensive documentation of the folk revival movement reflecting the tremendous interest in traditional music that has blossomed since the late 1950s. Photographs, recordings, ephemera, periodicals, and manuscript materials trace the rise of folk and bluegrass festivals in the United States; promote the study of folksong clubs, coffeehouses, fan clubs, and grassroots organizations; and chronicle the output of recording companies.\nThe SFC contains over 200,000 sound recordings, including cylinders, acetate discs, wire recordings, 78 rpm and 45 rpm discs, LPs, cassettes, CDs, and open reel tapes. Moving image materials include over 3,000 video recordings and 18 million feet of motion picture film. Other materials include thousands of photographs, song folios, posters, manuscript materials, ephemeral items, and research files, as well as an exceptionally strong collection of discographical materials for the 78 rpm era.\n\n\n\n"

(Baslers speak a unique dialect, but standard German will serve equally well.) The archivists also routinely handle inquiries in French and Italian, both of which are official languages in Switzerland. \nMany English speakers live and work in Basel without learning German, but English is seldom in use at this archive. The archivists will attempt to communicate in English, but relying on English alone is not advisable.\n\n Layout\nThe archive is housed in a purpose-built stone building completed in 1898, and most recently renovated in 1999. The richly decorated reading room and offices are located on the first floor (above the ground floor). The Garderobe, with lockers for personal belongings, is in the basement (Untergeschoss). A large sign in the entrance lobby gives clear directions to both. \nThe courtyard is surrounded on two sides by an arcade containing murals by Heinrich Altherr, painted 1942-1946. This area is frequented by tourists especially during the summer months. Since 1999 the walkway to the archive entrance has been inset with chrome steel letters, after a design by artist R̩my Zaugg.\n\n Directions\nThe Staatsarchiv is located above the Rhine on the M�_nsterberg, the heart of the old city. Parking is not readily available nearby. It is best to use public transportation. Take a tram or bus to the Marktplatz, where the bright red Rathaus serves as a landmark. On the Rathaus side of the square, walk up the steep, staired alley between the Globus department store and Tally Weijl clothing store. This is called Martinsg�_sslein. At the top of this alley, the Staatsarchiv is immediately on your right.\nWhen exploring Basel, remember that the Martinskirche (St. Martin's Church) is next to the Staatsarchiv. Its distinctive steeple can be useful when finding the way back to the archive.\n\n Holdings\n Description of holdings\nThe Staatsarchiv's holdings are organized as follows: \n\nHA Hauptarchiv\nAHA ��lteres Hauptarchiv (1098-ca. 1936)\nNHA Neueres Hauptarchiv (ca. 1936- )\nVR-REG Verfassungsgebende Versammlungen\nGR-REG Grosser Rat\nRR-REG Regierungsrat und Staatskanzlei\nBD-REG Baudepartement\nED-REG Erziehungsdepartement\nFD-REG Finanzdepartement\nJD-REG Justizdepartement\nPD-REG Sicherheitsdepartement (bis 1978: Polizeidepartement, 1979 bis 2004: Polizei- und Milit�_rdepartement)\nSD-REG Gesundheitsdepartement (bis 1.

With the 1834 partition of the Canton of Basel into Basel-City and Basel-Country, records pertaining solely to districts in Basel-Country were transferred to the new government in Liestal. \nThe modern history of the Staatsarchiv begins in 1877, when the governing council appointed historian Rudolf Wackernagel to the newly created post of state archivist (Staatsarchivar). During his tenure, which ended in 1904, the Staatsarchiv expanded to incorporate judicial, guild, ecclesiastical, and private archives. The organization of the archive's assets into a Hauptarchiv and several Nebenarchive dates from Wackernagel's tenure. The archive also moved into its present headquarters on Martinsgasse.\nIn 1960-1961 archivists compiled a new Reportorium for both the Haupt- and Nebenarchive. This is the basis for the ��ltere Hauptarchiv and ��ltere Nebenarchive records series. At this time the archive also began the transition from Pertinenzprinzip (relevance) to Provenienzprinzip (provenance) as the basis for organizing records. The reorganized Neuere Hauptarchiv comprises state documents dating from the mid-1930s. Development of the Neuere Nebenarchive began in 2000, and new series for the Gerichtsarchiv, Gemeindearchiv (including established Christian churches and the Israelitische Gemeinde), and the Universit�_tsarchiv were established in 2001, terminating the older series.\nOff-site storage of records was a pressing problem for much of the 20th century. The Staatsarchiv obtained its first secure off-site storehouse in 1981, and it acquired a satellite location in 1993. The archive publishes an annual report (Jahresbericht) and research publications, including the series Quellen und Forschungen.\n\n Catalogues & finding aids\nOnline catalog\n\nA keyword search of the online catalog does not always give comprehensive results. It is a good idea to browse the hierarchical catalog as well. \nThe archive's holdings are comparatively well documented. Two computer workstations are available for catalog searches in a room adjacent to the Lesesaal. In case the online catalog is unavailable, a printed, bound catalog is available in the same room.\n\n Languages of materials\nMost materials are in German. Archivists have reference materials to assist in interpreting the letter forms in older manuscripts.\n\n Restrictions & difficulties\nAccess to the archive by people with disabilities is difficult, both because of the age and design of the building, and because of its location in the oldest section of Basel. At least four flights of stairs must be negotiated in order to reach the Lesesaal. \nEven the alleys that give the most immediate access to Martinsgasse and the Staatsarchiv all have steep stairways. To avoid these, approach the archive from the M�_nsterplatz. \n\n Classified material\nThe archive's handling of sensitive material is governed by the Swiss federal Bundesgesetz �_ber die Archivierung (1998) and by the cantonal government's Archive Law (Archivgesetz), most recently amended in September 1999. \nBoth the federal and cantonal laws provide for protection of official secrets (Berufsgeheimnisse), the unauthorized disclosure of which can result in a fine or imprisonment. This places a limitation on the right of archives to receive official materials and the duty of government bodies to provide them. \n\nKanton Basel-Stadt: Archivgesetz\nStrafgesetzbuch: Artikel 321\n\n Future of the archive\nThe Staatsarchiv is defined by law as an essential institution of the cantonal government. Its future appears secure.\n\n Research procedures\n Access\nAccess to this public archive is free, and no permits, identity documents, or letters of reference are required. \nSome private archives housed in the Staatsarchiv can only be accessed with a letter of permission from the private party responsible for the archive. Ask the archive staff whether permission is required for any materials from a series beginning with \"PA.\"\n\n First visit\nMaterials can be ordered in advance through the website, to be available at the time of your first visit. See #Document ordering below. \nThe gate to the Staatsarchiv opens on a courtyard. Climb the stairs to the first door on the right.\n\n Permitted and prohibited items\nPermitted: Laptop computers, cameras, pens and pencils, loose papers. \nProhibited: Bags and satchels, or anything in which materials could be concealed.\n\n Document ordering\nDocuments can be requested in advance either in writing or with online forms. At the archive, materials are ordered by filling out a card, and requests are processed several times a day, usually on the hour.\n\n Document delivery\nDocument retrieval is commendably prompt, seldom taking more than one hour. Documents are ordered by filling out a card. (Note that Signatur refers to the call number of the desired document.) On arrival, documents are usually brought directly to the person who ordered them. When you are finished with them, you should take the documents to the archivist at the desk in the Lesesaal and indicate that you are finished. \nThere appears to be no fixed limit on the number of documents that can be requested at once. Researchers should simply be considerate of other simultaneous demands on the archivists' time.\n\n Photocopying, photography, microfilming\n(what are costs, permits, and page limits?  how long do you have to wait?)\n\n Key forms\n(what are the main forms that the archive uses? if possible, provide links to copies or post copies directly)\n\n Key individuals\n Archive staff\nAll of the archival staff are courteous, helpful, and patient with foreign researchers.\n\n Scholars\n(scholars who are familiar with this archive)\n\n Bibliography\nThe Staatsarchiv website includes a list of literature on the archive's history and holdings (in German). \nNotable works in English that cite the Staatsarchiv's holdings:\n\nBurnett, Amy Nelson.

ISBN 0521472229\n\n Practicalities\n Food\nFood and drink in Basel are relatively expensive, but there are several reasonably affordable restaurants within a short walk of the Staatsarchiv. A quick stand-up lunch can be had at a kiosk in the Marktplatz. Try crossing the Mittlere Br�_cke to the crowded \"shopping mile\" in the Clara district of Kleinbasel.\nThe Mensa at the University of Basel provides good, affordable food, and offers discounted prices to foreigners with a valid student ID. The main cafeteria is at Bernoullistrasse 16, near the University Library. A vegetarian and organic (biologisch) selection is offered in a separate upstairs cafeteria. The daily menu is online. Addresses and operating hours for other Mensa locations are also posted online.\n\n Lockers\nPersonal items are to be stored in a coin-operated locker in the Garderobe, located in the basement. The required two-franc coin is returned when the locker is unlocked to retrieve the items.\n\n Washrooms\nTwo toilets/restrooms/WCs, one for men and one for women, are located across the hall from the Lesesaal. They do not accommodate wheelchairs. \nThe toilets are very clean, and as is customary in Switzerland, visitors are expected to help keep them that way. The posted notice \"Wir bitten nach Sauberkeit\" means the toilet brush is not just for the housekeeper to use. \nThere is a single wash basin and mirror in the hall. The water from the tap is safe to drink and tastes fresh.\n\n Transportation\nPublic transportation is recommended. Parking places near the Staatsarchiv are few and restricted.\nFor details on finding the Staatsarchiv within Basel, see Directions, above.\nFor transportation to and from Basel, see Wikitravel.\n\n Internet access\nWireless Internet access is available, with occasional service interruptions lasting for an entire work day. The service is free and requires no registration. Tables in the Lesesaal have electric outlets for laptops.\n\n Funding\n Bookstore\nThere is no bookstore at the archive.\nAnnual reports are available online in PDF form, at no charge. Other Staatsarchiv publications are available from Basel libraries.\n\n See also\n Basel libraries\n IDS Basel Bern (combined library catalog)\n Basler Bibliographie\n\n Universit�_tsbibliothek (University Library)\n\n Basel museums\n Museen Basel Online\n Historisches Museum Basel\n Kunstmuseum Basel & Kupferstichkabinett\n Fondation Herzog\n J�_disches Museum\n Karikatur & Cartoon Museum\n Museum der Kulturen Basel\n Pharmazie-Historisches Museum\n\n Universit�_t Basel\n Home page\n Forschungsdatenbank\n Historisches Seminar\n Universit�_tsbibliothek (University Library)\n\n Kanton Basel-Landschaft\n Staatsarchiv Basel-Landschaft\n Kantonsbibliothek Basel-Landschaft\n Gesellschaft f�_r regionale Kulturgeschichte Baselland\n Augusta Raurica (Roman settlement)\n Pro Augusta Raurica Foundation\n\n Other historical resources\n Archives de l'Ancien ��v̻ch̩ de B̢le\n Historische und Antiquarische Gesellschaft zu Basel (HAG)\n Historisches Lexikon der Schweiz\n Schweizerische Gesellschaft f�_r Geschichte\n\n\n\n"

The vast majority of these documents are historical records representing and illustrating the work of the administration and governement of the state. Note that the town of Fribourg was separated from the state administration in 1803. The municipality of Fribourg has its own records and its own archives from this date onwards, while up to the end of the 18th c. the Republic of Fribourg encompassed town and canton. \nThe State Archive also preserves selected private archives of persons, families, religious orders and monasteries, organisations and corporations that are important for the history of the canton Fribourg. We also hold the church records for all the parishes of canton on microfilm. A list of these church records, important for family research, is available on the website.\nNote that historically Fribourg was always bilingual. Medieval documents are in Latin, French or German (the official language of the administration was German between 1481 and 1798). From the 19th c. records are mainly in French except for the German speaking parts of the canton. Church records for catholic parishes are in Latin.      \n\n Research procedures\n Access\nThere are 2 research rooms, one with large tables, catalogues for the holdings and for the small reference library on site, the other equipped with 5 microfilm readers and self-serve mcirofilms. There are no requirements for making an appointment or reservation, however it is recommended for researchers wishing to peruse the church records to reserve a microfilm reader at least a couple of days in advance by email or phone (access to the church records is exclusively by microfilm). Note that civil registers have been introduced in Switzerland in 1876. All vital records after this date can only be found at the local civil registry offices and not in the State Archives. Details and contact infos can be found on the State Archives website.   \n\n Permitted and prohibited items\nPermitted:\n\nlaptop computers (power provided, no wifi Internet access), cameras and phones, writing material, documentation\n\nProhibited:\n\nbags or brief cases in any form, vests, mantles etc. (unguarded lockers are provided). Eating and drinking are not allowed inside the building.\n\n Document ordering and delivery\nDocuments and library books can be ordered at any time during the opening hours (also in advance by mail or phone) and are being delivered as fast as possible to the reading room. There is a limit of 5 archival documents per researcher to be viewed at the same time. \n\n Photocopying, photography, microfilming\nPhotocopies are allowed upon inspection by staff for unbound lose paper sheets of modern documents and cost 0.20 Swiss Francs per copy. Bound documents, old papers and parchments etc. are not allowed to be photocopied. Digital cameras are recommended for these cases and can be freely used in the research room. 3 microfilm readers are equipped with photocopiers (same fee per copy as above).\n\n Key individuals\n Practicalities\nThere is no dedicated parking space, public transports are recommended to access the site.\n\n See also\n(links to relevant websites and resources)\n\n\n\n"

The Art Gallery is open Tuesday���Friday, 9:00 a.m.���4:30 p.m., and Saturday, 9:00 a.m.���3:15 p.m.\n\n Collection Summary\nThe State Historical Society of Missouri maintains reference and newspaper libraries, a manuscript collection, a historical art collection, and a photo archives for public and scholarly use.\nThe society�۪s reference library contains books, pamphlets, journals, and official publications that document the history of the state and the Midwest. The holdings range from monographs and biographies to city directories and county histories to family histories and organizational histories. Within the library are some rare and priceless assemblages of books. The J. Christian Bay Collection of 5,200 books and documents is one of the most valuable in the field of Midwestern Americana. The Alice Irene Fitzgerald Collection features Missouri�۪s literary heritage for children and youth. Both the Mahan Memorial Mark Twain Collection and the Eugene Field Collection are outstanding, as is the Bishop William Fletcher McMurry Collection of materials relating to the Methodist church. The Francis A. Sampson Collection of rare books and pamphlets is particularly valuable for its early official state publications.  The reference library includes published material; unpublished manuscripts are located on the other side of Ellis Library in the Western Historical Manuscript Collection.\nThe society has the largest and most complete collection of Missouri newspapers in the nation. State newspapers from 1808 to the present are preserved in more than 1,275 bound volumes and some 52,398 reels of microfilm. In addition, 297 current newspapers from every Missouri county arrive weekly. A guide to the newspaper collection on microfilm is available on the society�۪s web site. For genealogical research, the society�۪s microfilm collection of the U.S. census schedules is one of the largest in the Midwest, with a total of 6,969 reels covering 48 states, including 1,518 reels of Missouri census records from 1830 to 1880 and 1900 to 1930.\nA constantly growing collection of primary sources has been assembled to document all aspects of life in Missouri and the Midwest. In addition to the more traditional political, military, and diplomatic records, users will find information on religion, the arts, education, the professions, ethnic and social groupings and movements, all aspects of the economy, and data on the lives of both famous and obscure individuals that in totality illustrate the experience and culture of the region. \nMore than 4,300 maps, ranging from early river routes, trails, and roads to modern railroad and highway routes, are owned by the Society. Atlases, gazetteers, early guidebooks, and statistical maps are on file, as is a complete assemblage of the state�۪s official topographic maps. The earliest map in the collection, published in 1684, charts the Louisiana Territory claimed for France by LaSalle. \nThe society�۪s historical art collection, a valuable supplement to its printed materials, contains the major national collection of paintings and portraits by 19th-century artist George Caleb Bingham. The Thomas Hart Benton Collection includes signed lithographs, drawings, and watercolors. Ninety colored engravings by Karl Bodmer depicting Western Plains Indians greatly enhance the collection. Contemporary Missouri artists are represented by the works of Frank B. Nuderscher, Frederick Oakes Sylvester, William Knox, Carl Gentry, Fred Geary, Fred Shane, Charles Schwartz, Frank Stack, Siegfried Reinhardt, Larry Young, and Roscoe Misselhorn. The editorial cartoon collection includes original works by Daniel Fitzpatrick, S. J. Ray, Bill Mauldin, Don Hesse, Tom Engelhardt, and others. The photograph archives contains more than 100,000 photographs, postcards, copy photographs, and photographs of drawings, engravings, maps, paintings, political cartoons, and other images. The collection is an outstanding research source for students, scholars, writers, local historians, genealogists, and others interested in images of the people and the events that shaped the development of Missouri, the Midwest, and the West.\n\n Usage Discussion\nSuggestions for approaching the material:\nHousing and getting by for less in the area:  An inexpensive hotel located nearby on Broadway is the Regency Downtown.  It is a little run-down, but it is very clean and affordable.  It includes a free continental breakfast, free wi-fi, and refrigerators and microwaves in most rooms.  It is within walking distance of the State Historical Society and its sister organization, the Western Historical Manuscript Collection.\nThere are a number of restaurants within walking distance of the SHS, including Noodles & Company (with Italian noodle dishes and Asian noodle dishes), Chipotle, and the Heidelberg.  The student union (on Hitt Street) includes fast food options as well.  There is also a McDonalds on the north side of Ellis Library on the Lowry Mall.\n\n\n\n"

Summer hours are 9am-5pm Monday through Friday.  Researchers must present ID and register to use special collections material.  Some material is stored offsite so researchers planning to travel from out-of-town are encouraged to call ahead.\n\n  Online Catalogs and Finding Aids \nMany of SCRC's books and collections are accessible through the library's main catalog.  A complete listing of all 2000+ collections as well as detailed finding aids and enhanced search capabilities for the manuscript collections are available on our Finding Aids page.\n\n Collection Summary\nSyracuse University's Special Collections Research Center (SCRC) maintains and provides access to distinguished collections of rare books, manuscripts, and other archival materials. Syracuse University students, faculty, and other scholars have available to them more than 100,000 printed works and 2000 archival collections, including important editions, manuscripts, documents, letters, diaries, drawings, photographs, and memorabilia.  The Special Collections Research Center regularly presents exhibitions from its varied collections in its gallery space. It also offers such services as photocopies and reproductions of material in the collection for publication, as well as class visits and group tours.\n\n Rare books\nThe collection includes a wide array of historic and literary classics indispensable to the university�۪s varied curriculum, as well as many distinguished special collections unique to Syracuse University. These special collections make SCRC an indispensable resource for researchers interested in a variety of topics such as the creative expression of Radicalism across a variety of topics, Beat literature and post-Beat influence on modern literature, 19th and 20th century authors, New York State history and religious communities, and many others.\nSCRC also has extensive holdings relating to antiquarian books and early publishing in the Central and Upstate New York region.\n\n Audio recordings\nSCRC is home to the Belfer Audio Archive, one of the largest sound archives in the country.  Founded in 1963 with a collection of 150,000 recordings, the Library's archive of sound recordings and related items has grown to over 340,000 items housed in a specially designed, climate-controlled facility on campus. Currently it is the fourth largest sound archive in the country and includes formats from the earliest experimental recordings on tinfoil to modern digital media. The collection of 22,000 cylinder records is the largest held by any private institution in North America, and one of the largest in the world.  The Belfer also produces Sound Beat, a daily 90-second show highlighting rare, unusual, or interesting audio material held by SCRC.  Sound Beat is carried by dozens of NPR stations across the country.\n\n Manuscript collections\nSCRC's manuscript collections number more than 2000 collections and measure in excess of 30,000 linear feet, and have contributed to research produced around the world.  In addition to extensive material relating to New York State (over 200 collections), our strengths are concentrated in the 19th and 20th centuries. \nSee our Subject Strengths page for an overview of our collecting areas and a summary of our holdings in each area.\n\n Usage Discussion\nSuggestions for approaching the material:\nHousing and getting by for less in the area: \nThe closest hotel is the University Sheraton.  Also within walking distance is the Genesee Grande.\n\n\n  Fellowships and Funding Opportunities \nSCRC offers several internships, awards and fellowships.

In an effort to tell the Army�۪s history through the eyes of its soldiers, the AHEC combines the familiar Army Military History Institute (MHI), the future Army Heritage Museum, a state of the art Conservation Center, Visitor and Education Center, and the Army Heritage Trail. The AHEC moved into a newly built facility last year on a 55-acre tract of land located adjacent to the Carlisle Barracks golf course. This 67,000-square-foot building provides enhanced protection for the MHI collection and improved facilities for patrons and staff. While the Heritage Trail nears completion, the AHEC breaks ground in fall 2006 on the Visitor and Education Center. The Museum and Conservation Center are scheduled to be complete by end of FY 2009. \nThe Army Heritage Museum, scheduled to open in 2009, is designed to highlight an extensive collection of military artifacts related to the service of individual soldiers throughout the history of the Army. The museum�۪s mission is to examine the experience of the individual soldier through the objects that they used, wore, saved, and collected. These objects speak most eloquently of the soldier�۪s service to his country long after the soldier can no longer speak for himself. The wealth of individual soldier�۪s stories depicted in the 50,000 square feet of exhibit galleries serve to illustrate the history of the Army and bring it to life. \nThe Visitor and Education Center will be the hub of the new complex, and will provide a general orientation area for visitors to the AHEC. Besides being the architectural highlight of the site, the Visitor and Education Center will include a lecture hall, conference facilities, classrooms, auditorium, restaurant, and rotating display gallery. The Visitor Center�۪s education programs will include both in-house and outreach programs of national scope for primary, secondary, and continuing education. The center also offers a variety of special events throughout the year including two living history events on the Army Heritage Trail, a nine-stop historical recreation of different theaters of operations and time periods. The conference facilities cater to veterans groups, special interest history organizations, and national conferences. The Visitor and Education Center also distributes the famous veteran�۪s survey from which is recorded the history of the American soldier, past, present and future.\nThe U.S. Army Military History Institute is the Army agency charged with the collection, preservation, and making available for study of source materials (other than official records) relating to the American Army and ground warfare. The holdings include 325,000 printed books dating from 1494; 60,000 periodicals including 9,708 bound volumes; 1,700,000 photographs dating from the Mexican War; 11,000,000 manuscripts to include personal manuscripts, diaries, letters, and memoirs; 19,500 maps; 252,000 authority publications; artifacts; video and audio recordings; and microforms.\nAreas of particular strength include a large collection of published unit histories, books on U.S. and foreign military affairs, personal papers of key U.S. Army officers of the 20th century, and Civil War manuscripts and photographs. The Veteran�۪s Survey Project (Spanish-American War, World War I, World War II, Korea, Vietnam, and Cold War) are important collections gathered through the canvassing of surviving veterans from these conflicts. The institute also contains oral history transcripts of extensive interviews with retired senior officers and civilian officials of the U.S. Army.\nConservation Center. The AHEC embodies the highest standards of quality for conservation and preservation of photographs, manuscripts and the artifacts of the Army. The Conservation Center will serve to build on this mission with a 35,000 square foot, state of the art Museum Support Facility scheduled for construction in FY 2009. The multi-functional structure is slated to house conservation and analytical laboratories as well as macro object storage for the Army Heritage Museum. The Conservation Center will take a holistic approach to its mission; individual object treatment and whole collections care; cutting-edge conservation science research to benefit the collection; educational opportunities for the public dealing with proper stewardship; and care of cultural and historical heritage materials.\nThe Army Heritage Trail sits on the grounds of the AHEC, is a mile long, and highlights all of the Army�۪s major campaigns with artifacts and periodic vignettes. Settings include Revolutionary War earthwork redoubt, a section of the Antietam battlefield, a Civil War winter encampment with cabins, a World War I trench system, a World War II company area, a replicated section of the Omaha beachhead on D-Day, and an interpretation of the Viet Nam helicopter air assault concept. Designed as a stage for living history presentations by living historians serving as interpreters, the trail is open now for visitors.\n\n Usage Discussion\nSuggestions for approaching the material:\nHousing and getting by for less in the area:\n\n\n\n"

Its aim is to ���collect, preserve and give permanent access to key U.K. websites for future generations.�۝ The project, which began in 2004, currently archives more than 9000 titles, reflecting a cross-section of British social and political life. The selected sites are either nominated by specialists inside or outside the library, or by members of the public. The archive is designed to appeal to a wide range of users, and content can be discovered in several ways: Users can search by title or full-text, and can also browse collections by subject or genre. In addition, ���special collections�۝ are compiled by curators and subject specialists in collaboration with key organizations, including collections of web sites on London�۪s mayoral election 2008, or on the British countryside, or a collection of a wide range of web logs by private citizens as well as institutions. \nThe U.K. Web Archive is a work in progress, and reflects many of the challenges of archiving the dynamic web, and its changes over time: For example, the context of archived websites is often not evident, the display not always reflects the original design, and numerous links from the original sites no longer work. Many audio-visual formats cannot yet be archived. The UK Web archive, therefore, is not only an interesting resource, but also an important model and experiment in archiving the web in the future.\n\n\n\n"

The Records Service provides a way for university offices to manage their records so that those of enduring value become part of the University Archives in accordance with North Carolina Public Records Law.\nThe university's historical records were initially deposited in the Southern Historical Collection (SHC), founded in 1930. In the early 1950s, the Library began to segregate the large volume of university records from the SHC. In February 1978, Chancellor Ferebee Taylor recognized the University Archives and Records Service as the official repository for university records. Today the Archives includes roughly five million items.\nThe types of records in the University Archives include:\n\nminutes of the boards of trustees\ncorrespondence of chancellors and presidents\nminutes of faculty meetings\nrecords of student organizations and government\nreports of faculty committees\n\n  Major Topic Areas \nRecords in the University Archives serve not only to document the activities of the university and its offices for official and legal purposes, but they also offer a wide array of research opportunities, including support for work on:\n\nacademic freedom (including the Speaker Ban controversy)\nbuildings and grounds\ncollege athletics (including Title IX)\ncurriculum development\ndesegregation\nmedical education\nNorth Carolina history\npublic higher education\nstudent conduct and discipline\nstudent intellectual life\ntown and gown relations\n\n\n\n"

If you are coming to visit us from outside Berkeley, we recommend that you take public transportation. If you must drive, please be aware that there is very limited public parking on campus, and permits may be required. There is street and metered parking near the campus, and they are strictly enforced by the City of Berkeley.\n\n Working language(s)\n(what languages do you need, and what languages can you limp by on?)\nAbout the Collection:\nThe Bancroft Library is the primary special collections library at the University of California, Berkeley. One of the largest and most heavily used libraries of manuscripts, rare books, and unique materials in the United States, Bancroft supports major research and instructional activities and plays a leading role in the development of the University's research collections.\nBancroft's holdings include:\nmore than 600,000 volumes\n60,000,000 manuscript items\n8,000,000 photographs/pictorial materials\n43,000 microforms\n23,000 maps\n\n Research procedures\n Access\n(OskiCat, the web-based UCB online catalog, is the main source of information concerning all Bancroft Library materials and collections. Much of the same information can also be found on MELVYL, the UC system-wide online catalog. OskiCat and MELVYL are supplemented by card catalogs, finding aids for manuscript and pictorial collections, and a small reference collection housed in the library's Reading Room.\nAn important goal of The Bancroft Library is to preserve the physical integrity of its collections for future generations. This requires certain restrictions on availability and use. All Bancroft's items, books or manuscripts, must be viewed on the premises. While the library encourages the utilization of its unique materials, some of the printed items in its collections are also available at other libraries which offer stack access, circulating privileges, and self-service photocopying -- reader services which a special collections library cannot, by its nature, provide. By using OskiCat and MELVYL thoroughly, researchers can usually determine if another copy or edition of the item they seek is available elsewhere in the UC Library system. If Bancroft's copy is the only one available, it can usually be paged and read in the Reading Room. (The exception is extremely rare or fragile imprints -- many of which, however, may be available on microfilm). Contact Susan Snyder, Head of Public Services, for permission to use original manuscript collections that exist on microfilm.\n\n Permitted and prohibited items\n(if possible, account for laptop computers, cameras, scanners, phones, pens and pencils, loose papers, and so on)\n\nPermitted:\nProhibited:\n\n Document ordering and delivery\nBancroft Material Request Form\nPre-order materials from both Bancroft and the off-site storage facility (NRLF).\nRestrictions: Vault, MTP, CTP, TYP, Map, Oversized (ff, fff, pff, pfff), Restricted, and Unprocessed material MUST be requested in person, NOT online. Oversized materials housed at NRLF are exempt from this restriction.\nEach call number must have its own form. For collections with multiple containers, up to 5 volumes/boxes/cartons may be requested per form. \nThe maximum limit for online requests is 5 physical items per day. \nPlease prioritize your requests.\nItems will be returned 2 weeks after your planned date(s) of visit if they are not viewed. You will not be contacted when your request is available to view. You will only be contacted if there is a problem with your request.\nOff-site NRLF material is usually available for viewing in the reading room at 10am three business days after the initial request. To ensure receipt of material, please submit your order at least one week prior to your visit.\n\n Photocopying, photography, microfilming\nThe Duplication Services Unit is responsible for providing, where possible, xerographic or photographic copies of Bancroft Library materials. Because the library's holdings vary widely in terms of rarity, condition and format, each request for reproduction will be reviewed by staff. General guidelines, however, are contained in a comprehensive Policies/Procedures section.\nForms\nOnline forms for photocopy and photographic reproduction are available.\nPhotocopying\nPrices and procedures for photocopying vary, depending on whether the item to be photocopied is printed material or manuscript material, and whether the order is placed at the library, by mail, or via interlibrary loan. For further information, please consult the Services/Fees section.\nMaterials deemed too fragile for photocopying may, where condition permits, be suitable for microfilming. Once an item has been microfilmed, the original may no longer be photocopied, but paper copies may be obtained by reader-printer.\nPhotographic Reproduction\nThrough the Digital Imaging and Preservation Microfilm Labs, the Bancroft Library offers a wide range of photographic services: digital scans, and original and duplicate microfilming. For details, see Services/Fees. This section also contains information on obtaining permission to publish pictorial images. Most requests for publication are subject to use fees.\nDuplication of large format material, architectural drawings, and all audiovisual materials is performed by outside contractors, and is arranged through consultation with the Head of Public Services, Susan Snyder.\n\nThe Bancroft Library now allows personal cameras to be used in the Reading Room. There will be a $10 charge per day. Please refer to the Personal Camera Use page for further info on the Library's policies.\nPermissions\nBancroft material may be available for use in publications. For information about permissions and associated use fees, go to the Online Forms and select Request for Permission to Publish/Letter Agreement form, or contact the Head of Public Services, Susan Snyder.\n\n Key individuals\n(give names of archive staff and other individuals who can help researchers)\n\n Practicalities\nTo safeguard the collections from potential loss, readers must deposit coats, bags, briefcases, handbags, umbrellas, and other items not expressly needed for research in the locker room located on the right-hand side of the east entrance. Coin-operated lockers are available for a quarter, which is refunded. All items brought into the Reading Room must be submitted for inspection at the Registration Desk when you leave the Reading Room.\n\n See also\nlibrary Finding Aids\nhttp://oac.cdlib.org/institutions/UC+Berkeley::Bancroft+Library\n\n\n\n"

Holdings that have influenced public thought or legislation include the 5,400 photographs of child labor made by Lewis Hine and the mining photographs (1870-1895) by George Bretz. Equally important are the holdings illustrating the development of the aesthetic principles of photography.

Approx. 17,000 records of photographs can be searched in the Imcat database with new records and images being added weekly.  These holdings are supplemented by the Edward L. Bafford Photographic Book Collection, which includes approximately 30,000 books and serials on the history and development of photography as an aesthetic medium with a special emphasis on photography as a social force. Books by and about individual photographers, schools of photography, exhibition catalogues and the primary journals can be found here.\n Science Fiction:  The Azriel Rosenfeld Science Fiction Research Collection is a growing collection currently holding approximately 8,000 books and 4,000 issues of science fiction & fantasy periodicals, science fiction criticism and reference works. For those with an interest in the \"Golden Age\" of science fiction, the collection has extensive holdings of science fiction \"pulps\" from the 1920's - 1950's plus original manuscripts, personal papers and a large collection of amateur press \"fanzines.\" \n Marylandia:  Our holdings on the history of Maryland include manuscripts and personal papers, an extensive archive of Baltimore Sun holdings and photographs, and the Arnold Collection, a 3,000 plus volume collection that includes 18th and 19th century accounts of travel through Maryland, local histories, and general Maryland historical texts.\n\n\n\n"

Visitors to the archives should check in with a guard at the Kress or Trescher entrances ��� an archives staff member will then come to meet you.\n\n Holdings\nOur collections include 2,500 feet of records ��� these records document the Museum's archaeological expeditions to every inhabited continent, the history of the Penn Museum, and the history of the practices of archaeology and anthropology. Further, we hold three-quarters of a million images and nearly one thousand reels of film. Our image collections span the fantastic and the banal ��� Levantine art from the Maison Bonfils and images of holes in the ground from archaeological sites taken by amateur photographers. Please don't hesitate to contact us to learn more about our exceptional collections.\n\n Documents\nThe archives�۪ collections document archaeological and anthropological fieldwork as well as the administrative and collections history of the University of Pennsylvania Museum. Archival organization reflects the museum�۪s curatorial and administrative divisions: Egypt, Near East, Mediterranean, Asia, the Americas, Africa and Oceania. Field documents begin with the first American excavations in the Near East: Nippur, Iraq, 1889-1900 and continue to document Penn�۪s expeditions throughout the world through the present.\n\n Films\nThanks to the generosity of the Internet Archive, nearly all of the archives' collection of films is available online. Film collections include the documentary footage of Watson Kintner and his travels to Guatemala, Guyana, Ecuador, Morocco, Pakistan, India, Indonesia, Nigeria, Australia, Iran, and Ethiopia, all filmed with a 16mm camera from 1933-1969. We also hold a few episodes of the well-loved television show \"What in the World?\", a museum-sponsored game show in which a panel of experts was asked to identify the culture, place and use of an obscure object taken from the museum's storerooms. While we encourage the use and re-use of our films for creative purposes, please note that the museum archives holds copyright to this content. To protect your interests, please be sure to contact the archives so that we can grant permission for the re-use of these films.\n\n Images\nOur photo archives include over 750,000 images. In addition to images of museum objects and photographs from Penn-sponsored expeditions, the photographic archives include major collections by Maison Bonfils, William Henry Jackson, John K.

Curtis, Giorgio Sommer, Desire Charnay, Fratelli Alinari, Lehnert & Landrock, Jessie Tarbox Beals, and other important figures in the history of photography.\n\n Research procedures\n Access\nPromoting and assisting scholars and students in their research and educational activities is a fundamental committment of the Penn Museum.  This assistance includes open access to photographic records and discounted rates for photographic services.  There are, however, restricted materials in our photographic archives which require prior permission from the director or a curator before use is permitted. Archives staff may restrict materials due to reasons of copyright law, preservation consideration, or donor agreements. Our images have been used in scholarly articles, textbooks, documentary films, and art projects, among other uses. We encourage inquiries about the scope of our image collections and their use in scholarly, artistic or commercial work. Although we do not yet have a public database of our entire collection, we are happy to provide reference consultation regarding the scope and contents of our collections either in person or remotely.\n\n Photocopying, photography, microfilming\nPhotocopies are available for 25 cents per page. Because of limited staff resources, we may not be able to fulfill photocopy requests of more than one hundred pages. We may need a few days to fulfill photocopy orders, and we're happy to mail them to you. We can also scan images for you. Reference scans (72 dpi jpg) are available for three dollars each; publication-quality scans (300 dpi tiff) are available for fifteen dollars each. We normally offer a three week turn-around for scans, however, we can rush the order for an additional fee. Please contact the archives staff for commercial rates.\n\n Practicalities\nWireless internet access and electrical outlets are available in the reading room ��� we encourage the use of laptops and digital cameras.

See the Archives' website for more details.\nApproximately 95% of our holdings are described in the UWM Libraries' online catalog, PantherCat. Although more numerous than the finding aids, these catalog records provide less extensive information about each collection. We recommend that researchers use both Archival Resources in Wisconsin and PantherCat to conduct comprehensive searches of our holdings.\n\n Collection Summary\nThe Archives Department has the two-fold mission of documenting the history of UWM and providing access to primary sources, largely from the metropolitan Milwaukee area, that have long-term research and instructional value for UWM academic programs. We also respond to the information needs of researchers worldwide, provide instruction sessions for UWM courses, host an annual lecture on local history, and display our holdings on campus and in the community. \nThe Archives serves the university�۪s historical needs by preserving and making accessible the records of UWM and its predecessor institutions. We acquire records from all levels of the university, including administrative and governance units; schools, colleges, and academic departments; athletic programs; and student organizations. The Archives also has a rich photograph collection, blueprints for most campus buildings, student newspapers, a complete run of yearbooks from 1896 to 1968, athletic films, and taped interviews with campus administrators. To assist in the preservation of UWM�۪s history, we administer the campus records management program.\n\n\n Usage Discussion\nSuggestions for approaching the material:\nHousing and getting by for less in the area: \n\n\n  Major Topic Areas \nThe Archives supports research and instruction at UWM by providing access to historically significant papers and records created or collected by individuals and organizations in the course of their activities. Collection strengths pertain to the following subject areas: \nSocial justice, including peace activism, anti-discrimination and civil liberties, health, political and economic action, and community action/neighborhood revitalization. \nRacial, ethnic, and other underrepresented populations in Milwaukee, including the Polish, Jewish, African American, Latino, and Native American communities. We also have extensive holdings pertaining to the history of Milwaukee women and Milwaukee�۪s lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender communities.\nMilwaukee�۪s brewing industry, as represented in the records of the Blatz Brewing Company, the Pabst Brewing Company, the A. Gettelman Brewing Company, and the Milwaukee Brewers�۪ Association.\nThe historical development of the archives profession in the United States, as represented in the records of the Society of American Archivists, the Midwest Archives Conference, and the Academy of Certified Archivists.\nSignificant individual collections include the WTMJ-TVnews film collection (1950-1980), the largest surviving body of television news footage in southeastern Wisconsin; the Roman B.J. Kwasniewski photograph collection documenting Milwaukee�۪s Polish south side from 1911 to 1947; the records of Milwaukee Mayor Henry Maier; and the editorial files of the Little Review magazine.\nThe Archives provides further access to primary sources by serving as an Area Research Center (ARC) of the Wisconsin Historical Society (WHS). The Milwaukee ARC Collection includes birth, death, marriage, naturalization, probate, and property records for Milwaukee, Ozaukee, Sheboygan, Washington, and Waukesha counties. By participating in this statewide network of ARCs, the Archives is able to provide local access to the holdings of the WHS and other ARCs via the ARC transfer system.\nFinally, the Archives maintains a reference collection of published sources that relate to its archival holdings and manuscript collections. It includes histories of area communities, businesses, organizations, and churches.\n\n\n\n"

      "Archive_Info": "The Virginia Historical Society, established in 1831, is a private, nonprofit institution that offers a library for historical and genealogical research, a museum with changing and permanent exhibitions, and an educational resource for scholars, teachers, and students. It has a staff of about 80 professional and support personnel and a membership of about 8,000. The governing board of trustees consists of members who serve six-year terms. The society�۪s library, museum, and offices are located at 428 North Boulevard in Richmond. Virginia House, a house museum owned and operated by the society, is located at 4301 Sulgrave Road in Richmond.\nOne floor of the 1998 building expansion houses the flagship exhibition The Story of Virginia, an American Experience. Two other floors are rented to the Virginia Department of Historic Resources, a state agency with extensive collections of Virginia archaeology and architectural records. In 2006 the society completed another new wing with a 500-seat auditorium, storage for collections, staff offices, a new long-term exhibition called Virginians at Work, and the Reynolds Center for Business History.\n\nContents\n\n1 Address and Contact Info\n2 Hours and usage restrictions\n3 Collection Summary\n4 Usage Discussion\n\n\n Address and Contact Info\nAddress: P.O.

Because the society was established as an independent, privately supported scholarly institution, its jurisdiction has never extended to the official records of the state. \nThe manuscript collections, holding more than 8,000,000 processed items, embrace personal, family, and corporate papers dating from the 17th century to the present. Included are the correspondence of colonial families, royal governors, revolutionary patriots, Virginia-born presidents, the Confederate hierarchy, and 20th-century Virginians; diaries, commonplace books, and plantation records; and the papers of businesses, churches, and educational and charitable organizations. Finding aids on the African American, Civil War, and women�۪s manuscript collections provide an overview of the most important groupings of documents.\nAlthough manuscripts constitute the most important single segment of the society�۪s holdings, they are only a part of the total collection. Holdings in books and serials number nearly 140,000 volumes. Rare books include early tracts on the settlement of Virginia, travel narratives, Virginia and Confederate imprints, and an extensive collection of 17th- and 18th-century architectural books and volumes once owned by celebrated Virginians. The map collection includes some 6,500 items dating from 1590 to the present. Virginia newspapers, from the first surviving copy of the Virginia Gazette (1736) to papers published in the mid-20th century, are available both in the original form and on microfilm. The society�۪s museum collections embrace original portraiture (800 pieces), prints, photographs, and outstanding examples of southern furniture, silverware, and decorative arts, as well as bookplates, sheet music, paper currency, paper ephemera, and the largest collection of Confederate-made weaponry in existence. In the society�۪s library and on its web site, an online catalog gives researchers access to all of these collections. Materials accessioned since August 1992 are entered in OCLC.\n\n Usage Discussion\nSuggestions for approaching the material:\nHousing and getting by for less in the area:\n\n\n\n"

Entries begin in 1940 for radio and 1948 for television, and we receive at least 1,000 new entries every year --programs by local, national, cable, and international producers. The collection provides a cultural cross-section of television from its infancy to the present day, featuring news, documentary, entertainment, educational, and children's programming. The judging for the Peabody awards is conducted by the Peabody Awards Office in the Grady School of Journalism from panel of distinguished television scholars, critics, and media professionals. The award ceremony is held every year in New York in late spring.\nGeorgia history is highlighted in three newsfilm collections. The WSB Newsfilm Collection contains raw news footage from 1949 to 1981. More than 5 million feet of film clips shows the history of Atlanta and the Southeast, spans the entire civil rights movement, and covers such social and cultural events as the desegregation of the University of Georgia.

Its holdings span Missouri's pre-statehood days to the present and chronicle many aspects of the history of the state and the trans-Mississippi West: social and cultural, religious and educational, military and political, economic and legal, business and labor, urban and rural, ethnic, environmental, and many others. The Collection represents present and former Missourians from many walks of life, and includes the correspondence, diaries, photographs, financial records, and other papers of pioneers, soldiers, workers, farmers, business leaders, educators, scientists, doctors, artists, writers, politicians, and itinerant preachers.\nThe Collection also serves as the archives for numerous state and national organizations and businesses, and holds materials that support the research and teaching interests of University faculty members. It is an approved repository of the Forest History Society, and other specially designated collections include the German Heritage Archives, the Missouri Folklore/Folklife Archives, the National Women and Media Collection, and the Archive of Soil Science.\n\n\n Access\nAll researchers, including those unaffiliated with a university or college, are welcome to use the resources of the Collection. Holdings are non-circulating and must be used on the premises. Researchers must provide two pieces of identification (one with a photo), and read and sign a rules and consent form before using manuscript material.\nSome collections require written permission from the donor to use and/or photocopy. \nOut-of-town researchers are encouraged to write prior to their visit to make their needs known so materials may be recalled from storage or the other campuses if necessary.\n\n Permitted and prohibited items\nProhibited: Cameras, scanners, and pens.\n\n Document ordering and delivery\nApproximately half the collections are stored off-site; they may be recalled and are usually available for use within 24 hours. Materials housed at one branch of WHMC may be loaned to any of the others; transfers from one campus to another usually takes 48 hours. Microfilmed collections may be borrowed through interlibrary loan.  Please contact reference staff at whmc@umsystem.edu with any questions.\n\n Photocopying, photography, microfilming\nAll photocopying is handled by the staff. Collections will not be reproduced in their entirety. Orders over 200 pages will be photocopied at the staff's discretion. Orders may be subject to Missouri sales tax and postage and handling is charged for orders that are mailed.

The library cooperates with UW-Madison�۪s General Library System in supporting a regional federal government documents repository. It functions as the official state government documents depository and has an extensive collection of Canadian federal and provincial government documents. Its newspaper collection dates to colonial days and is second only to the Library of Congress in numbers of issues. Extensive U.S. and Canadian history, ethnic, African American, and genealogical materials are also available. The library provides reference and information services in person, over the telephone, through correspondence and e-mail.  It also lends most of its materials to users in person and to other libraries through the state�۪s interlibrary loan system. The library�۪s catalog is available via (https://search.library.wisc.edu/) as part of UW-Madison�۪s online catalog MadCat, and the library�۪s web pages provide information about collections and services as well as a genealogical research service and a growing number of digital collections.\nIn addition to Wisconsin manuscripts and state and local government records, the society�۪s archives holds several collections of national scope on mass communications, social action, the Draper Manuscripts, U.S. labor history, the Wisconsin Center for Film and Theater Research, and the McCormick/International Harvester collection. The visual materials archive holds approximately 2.5 million historic photographs plus additional large collections of posters, sound recordings, maps, and atlases.  Wisconsin's role in the Civil War has attributed to a collection of over 25,000 letters, journals, papers, articles, and other works.   \nDistributed across the state, the society�۪s 14 Area Research Centers comprise a network of repositories for Wisconsin archives and manuscripts of regional significance and interest. Pioneered by the society and operated in cooperation with the host locations, these centers provide distributed access to materials pertinent to the region. A collection lending arrangement among all 14 centers permits wider access to materials and aids substantially in the dissemination of historical knowledge and the citizenry�۪s appreciation of the state�۪s heritage and history. The archives catalog ArCat and growing digital collections, available online at (http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/libraryarchives/), also provides information about collections, reference services, and current projects.\nThe society�۪s museum and historic sites divisions collect three-dimensional artifacts relating to the material culture of Wisconsin. The collections consist of approximately 300,000 historic artifacts and 350,000 prehistoric objects documenting Wisconsin history. The museum�۪s paintings and children�۪s clothing collections can be found online at (http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/museum/exhibits/). \n\n Usage Discussion\nSuggestions for approaching the material:\nThis website provides information regarding the process of searching the library catalog at the Wisconsin Historical Society.\n(http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/Content.aspx?dsNav=N:4294963828-4294963805&dsRecordDetails=R:CS4079)\nThis website provides information regarding the process of searching the archives collection at the Wisconsin Historical Society.\n(http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/Content.aspx?dsNav=N:4294963828-4294963805&dsRecordDetails=R:CS4080)\nObtaining Copies/Photographs\nIf you are unable to visit the archives, orders for copies of material can be placed with the society via email.  Orders via telephone are not accepted.  Information regarding pricing and photocopying procedures can be found here.\n(http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/Content.aspx?dsNav=N:4294963828-4294963805&dsRecordDetails=R:CS4018#Photo)\nHousing and getting by for less in the area:\nLocated in the heart of downtown Madison, Wisconsin, there are several hotels, restaurants, convenient stores, bus stations, bike rental stations, and tourist attractions within blocks of the Wisconsin Historical Society.  Due to Madison being a large college town, pricing at the previously listed establishments is very reasonable.  With that being said, if a scheduled visit to the archives falls on a week/weekend of a major athletic event for the University of Wisconsin, hotel room prices could be nearly doubled due to high demand.  For that reason, it is suggested that if a hotel room is needed, plan accordingly.\nParking and Accessibility\nAs of February 2016, construction on the neighboring buildings of the Wisconsin Historical Society impact street parking.  Information regarding parking options, elevators, wheelchair accessibility, and other questions can be answered at this website-- \n(http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/Content.aspx?dsNav=N:4294963828-4294963805&dsNavOnly=N:1080&dsRecordDetails=R:CS71#Parking)\nAmenities\nLockers are available at the Wisconsin Historical Society to store small items such as laptops and jackets.

Before visiting the department, please write or call in advance to ensure the availability of records relevant to your research. All collections are stored off-site, and require two business days' notice for retrieval. Permission is required for access to some materials.\nAnyone wishing to use collection materials must register annually. Registration is for the current academic year and expires on June 30th.

Researchers may also make an appointment with a specific reference staff member.\n\n  Online Catalogs and Finding Aids \n Orbis - Yale University Library Online Catalog. \nOrbis constitute the Yale University Library online public access catalog. To a greater or lesser degree, the holdings of each special collection can be identified using Orbis. Manuscripts and Archives has described all of its manuscript and Yale archival record units in Orbis.  \nTo limit a search to materials in Manuscripts and Archives, click on \"More Limits,\" then select \"Manuscripts and Archives (SML)\" from the list of collections.\n\n Yale Finding Aid Database\nThis database consists of finding aids for archival and manuscript materials at Yale University. Their purpose is to provide information about the creation, historical context, arrangement, and content of archival and manuscript collections as well as the information necessary for users to identify and request the portions relevant to their research. These finding aids vary in style, depth of detail, and amount of materials covered, but their common purpose is to describe and enable access to archival and manuscript collections.\n\n The Manuscripts and Archives Digital Images Database (MADID)\nThe Manuscripts and Archives Digital Images Database (MADID) contains digital reproductions of photographs, posters, drawings, text documents, and other images taken from the research collections of Manuscripts and Archives, Yale University Library. These images comprise only a small percentage of the department's holdings, being those requested by departmental patrons over the past several years. The database continues to grow as patrons request the digitization of additional materials.\n\n Collection Summary\nThe resources held by Manuscripts and Archives include over 1700 collections of personal and family papers and organizational records that document a variety of areas, and the Yale University Archives. The department also holds and makes available a multitude of Yale publications and many microfilm collections. The department also includes the Fortunoff Video Archive for Holocaust Testimonies, which currently holds more than 4,300 testimonies of willing individuals with first-hand experience of the Nazi persecutions, including those in hiding, survivors, bystanders, resistants, and liberators.\nThe collections held by Manuscripts and Archives document a wide array of persons, institutions, and subject areas. Most of these areas have a strong link to Yale, either to the institution itself; to the faculty, students, alumni, and other members of the Yale community; or to areas in which Yale has had strong teaching and research interests.  \n\n\n  Major Topic Areas \nManuscripts and Archives collects broadly in the areas of public policy and administration; diplomacy and international affairs; political and social thought and commentary; science, medicine, and the environment; legal and judicial history; the visual and performing arts; urban planning and architecture; environmental policy and affairs; psychology and psychiatry; and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender history and culture.

      "Archive_Info": "Prof. Ali Hasjmy was a youth leader in the Indonesian revolution in Aceh and later became the governor of Aceh after the province was split off from North Sumatra in 1959 (in response to the Darul Islam rebellion in the region).  He also served as the inaugural rector of IAIN Ar-Raniry, Banda Aceh, and led the Majelis Ulama Aceh.  Amazingly, Ali Hasjmy kept alive his interests in poetry, literature, and journalism long after he had become a major political and religious figure in the province.  In 1991, he established a foundation which now cares for his personal collection of books and papers.  Most locals come to to the library for the collection of secondary materials that they cannot find elsewhere.  The research materials at this library that are most interesting to foreign researchers are primarily to be found in the \"bags\" collection, including both all the proceedings of the conferences Ali Hasjmy attended for decades, as well as his personal papers.\n\nContents\n\n1 Orientation\n\n1.1 Coordinates\n\n1.1.1 Address\n1.1.2 Website\n\n\n1.2 Schedule & hours\n1.3 Working language(s)\n1.4 Directions to the archive\n\n\n2 Holdings\n\n2.1 Highlights\n\n\n3 Research procedures\n\n3.1 Access\n3.2 Permitted and prohibited items\n3.3 Document ordering and delivery\n3.4 Photocopying\n\n\n4 Key individuals\n5 Practicalities\n6 See also\n\n\n Orientation\n Coordinates\n Address\nJl. Sudirman, No. 28/29\nLamtemen, Banda Aceh, NAD, Indonesia\n\n Website\nYayasan Ali Hasjmy\n\n Schedule & hours\nMonday-Thursday, 8am-1pm; Friday 8am-11am\n\n Working language(s)\nAlmost everything in the collection is in Indonesian (Bahasa Indonesia); very little is in Acehnese (Bahasa Aceh) or Malay (Bahasa Melayu).\n\n Directions to the archive\nThe best way to get here, like most places in Banda Aceh, is by becak.  If you driver is unfamiliar with Jl. Sudirman, tell him lewat Setui, terus kiri di monumen.  You will then see the Yayasan on your right in about half a kilometer.\n\n Holdings\nThe foundation has written down the broad strokes of their collection in both special English and good Indonesian.  This outline gives excellent credit to some of the impressive manuscripts and religious documents that the collection houses, but downplays the real gem here, which is the \"bag collection.\"\n\n Highlights\nThe bag collection is literally bags, saved from all of the conferences that Prof. Ali Hasjmy attended over his long and prestigious academic career.  Several additional bags have been sequestered to house personal papers and his own works.  The very thick catalog is excellent at chronicling all of the articles and conference proceedings in the bags, but less complete when it comes to personal papers/ archival material.  Most of this, however, is found in the last few numbers of the collection.  Some papers are from Ali Hasjmy's time as governor, but more are from his later years as the head of the Majelis Ulama Aceh and from his work with IAIN Ar-Raniry, Banda Aceh.  Although the collection from his impressive early years as a youth activist during the revolution exists mostly in rare shelved material, a few papers from that period are still floating around in the bags.\n\n Research procedures\n Access\nNo special letters are needed to access the collection, however all foreign researchers are required to obtain a research permit (Surat Izin Penelitian) from MenRisTek for any academic research in Indonesia and to report themselves to the local government in each province where they conduct research.  For more information on this process, see Research Procedures for Foreigners from the Indonesian Ministry of Research and Technology.\nAlthough there is no cost to access this collection, you may be asked at the end of your time there to give a donation to the curator(s).  This is a perfectly accepted cost of doing business in places like Aceh, and furthermore it is probably a reasonable request considering the allotment made in the original wakf gift covers the collection itself and not its caretakers.\n\n Permitted and prohibited items\nAlthough the lack of posted rules means that staff can impose whatever rules they find prudent at the time, there are no restrictions on bringing laptops, notebooks, pens, etc., back to the reading table.  They do, however, ask that you leave your bag out front.  Cameras, and even taking page-by-page pictures, are also permitted.\n\n Document ordering and delivery\nThe great collection of secondary works ranging from history to literature to religion are standing on the shelves for self-access.  Anything else will require the assistance of the library staff.  To access the bags, they have a catalog for the contents of each of the 140-some-odd bags, but it is not entirely complete, often failing to mention the personal papers held in the last couple of bags.  Other collections also have their own catalogs, and the library staff can help you navigate them.  They will be delivered immediately, but they ask that you only have one on the reading table at a time, so that collections do not get mixed up together.\n\n Photocopying\nThe library staff can arrange for anything to be photocopied, but this will be done outside the foundation, and only available the next day (or sometimes after 2 days).  Good manners dictate that you should deposit money with the staff in advance when requesting photocopies, although payment only on receipt of the copies is theoretically possible.  Make it very clear in advance if you need specific receipts for any reason.\n\n Key individuals\n(give names of archive staff and other individuals who can help researchers)\n\n Practicalities\n See also\n(links to relevant websites and resources)\n\n\n\n"
